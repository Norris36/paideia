It's important to note that any deliberate cold exposure is superimposed on the circadian rhythm, which has a temperature minimum approximately two hours before waking up. As you wake up, your temperature rises slightly and continues to rise throughout the day, but in the late afternoon and evening, it starts to decline, which is important for accessing deep sleep. Deliberate cold exposure can be used to access specific states, but it's important to avoid it if your primary goal is to get to sleep.\",\n",
