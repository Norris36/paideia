Tool Moderate Exercise before cognetive:,"that I think you will find particularly interesting and useful. The title of this study is brief aerobic exerciseimmediately enhances visual attentional control and perceptual speed, testing the mediated role of feelings of energy. Now, the reason I like this study is first of all, it's a fairly large size sample group. They looked at 101 students. These were college-aged students and they had two groups. One group did 15 minutes of jogging at moderate intensity. So they did measure percent heart rates, et cetera, but this would be analogous to zone two cardio, which I've discussed on this podcast before. Zone two cardio is cardiovascular exercisethat places you at a level where you can hold a conversation with a little bit of strain, meaning that you can get the words out, but every once in a while you have to catch your breath whereas if you were to push any harder by any mechanismgoing faster or on a steeper incline, et cetera, that you would have a hard time carrying out a conversation. So zone two cardio is a common form of describingthat level of intensity that they call moderate intensity. So one group did 15 minute of jogging at moderate intensity, which I'm translating to roughly zone two cardio. The other group did 15 minutes of relaxation concentrationthat is somewhat akin to mindfulness meditation. And then they were analyzed for perceptual speed, visual attentional control, something called working memory, which is your ability to keep certain batches of information online. Just imagine someone telling you their phone number, and you have to remember that sequence of numbers in your head for some period of time, that's working memory. And it depends very heavily on the so-called prefrontal cortical networks, which are involved in planning and action. And they also looked at people's feelings of energy and they measured that subjectively, how energetic people felt. Now the major takeaways from this study that I'd like to emphasize are that the 15 minutes of jogging groupexperienced elevated levels of energy for some period of time after they ceased the exercisewhereas the group that did mindfulness meditation actually reported feeling more calmand having less overall energy. Now that's very subjective and indeed they used subjective measures to analyze energy, but what gets interesting is when they looked at performance on these various cognitive tasks and the two tasksthat they use were called the trail making tests, they have different versions of this, version A, version B, I don't want to go into too much detail, but version A essentially involves having a page of numbersthat are distributed somewhat randomly. So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight and so on, but distributed randomly across the pageand people have to use visual search to circle those numbers in sequence. So this involves visual attention, it involves some motor skills, involves a number of things that certainly require energy and focus. The second test was the trail making test part B, as I mentioned earlier, and this involved also circling numbers in sequence, but interspersed between those numbers were letters. So rather than just having to circle off numbers in sequence, they actually had to connect one, then the letter A, then two, then the letter B, et cetera and remember these are randomly distributed across the page. The major takeaway from the study is that the group that did the 15 minutes of moderate exercise prior to these two testsshowed significant decreases in the amount of time required to complete these tests accurately. That is interesting and indeed surprising at least to me, because there have been many studies looking at the effectsof mindfulness meditation on the ability to focus. The key variable in the study turned out to be energy. This subjectively measured feeling I should say of having more energy and thereby the ability to focus, especially in these high cognitive demand tasks. Now the takeaway from this study for all of us I think is pretty straightforward. If you are going to sit down to do some work that requires focus and working memoryand cognitive attention and especially if it's some visual spatial control, meaning you have to search for things on a page, you have to organize things on a page, so some writing, arithmetic, basically cognitive work of any kind, 15 minutes of moderate exercise done prior to that work about could be very beneficial for you. This does not mean that mindfulness meditation would not be a benefit to you. I wouldn't want you to conclude that, but if you had to choose between doing 15 minutes of mindfulness meditation and doing 15 minutes of moderate exerciseprior to a cognitive work about, I would say the 15 minutes of moderate exercise would bemore valuable at least based on the data in this paper. In many previous podcasts, I have talked about the powerful effects of doing thingslike mindfulness meditation, and other forms of NSDR, non-sleep deep rest. So these could be 20 minute naps or just lying there quietly with your eyes closed or yoga nidra or NSDR scripts are available on YouTubeand various other places free of cost of any kind. You just go to YouTube, put in NSDR, non-sleep deep rest. Those protocols have been shown to be very beneficialfor enhancing neuroplasticity, the changes in the brain and body that encodeor shift the neural circuits that allow for memory to change, that allow for learning to occur after a learning about. What I'm referring to today in this particular study is the use of moderate exercisein order to increase one's focus and attention in order to trigger that neuroplasticity. So the simple sequence here is get energetic and alert, do that prior to the learning about, engage in the cognitive work or learning about, and then mindfulness meditation, NSDR and so forth should follow. And if you would like to access this paper and like to look more at the details in the paper, we'll be sure to put a link in the show notes. The first author is Legrand. And again, the title of this paper is brief aerobic exerciseimmediately enhances visual potential control and perceptual speed, testing the mediating role of feeling of energy. And I also just want to emphasize immediately. I think most people out there are interested in tools and protocols that work the first timeand that work every time and indeed, I think this protocol fits that bill. I'm pleased to announce that I'm hosting two live events this May.",6501.0,1305.0,"The study titled ""Brief Aerobic Exercise Immediately Enhances Visual Attentional Control and Perceptual Speed, Testing the Mediated Role of Feelings of Energy"" looked at 101 college-aged students who were split into two groups. One group did 15 minutes of moderate intensity jogging, while the other group did 15 minutes of relaxation concentration similar to mindfulness meditation. The study found that the group that did moderate exercise showed significant decreases in the amount of time required to complete cognitive tasks that required focus, attention, and visual spatial control. The key variable in the study was energy, and the group that did exercise reported feeling more energetic and focused. The takeaway is that 15 minutes of moderate exercise prior to cognitive work could be very beneficial for enhancing focus and attention. Mindfulness meditation and NSDR are still valuable, but exercise prior to cognitive work is more valuable based on the data in this paper. The study emphasizes the importance of getting energetic and alert before engaging in cognitive work to trigger neuroplasticity. The paper's first author is Legrand, and the link to the paper will be in the show notes.","What did the study by Legrand et al. find about the effects of 15 minutes of moderate exercise on cognitive tasks that require focus, attention, and visual spatial control, and how does it compare to mindfulness meditation and NSDR?",Cold Exposure,Andrew Huberman,100,1685322425
Circadian Rhythm & Body Temperature:,"Let's talk about the use of cold for health and performance. I confess I love this topic because it takes me back to my undergraduate yearswhen I worked in a laboratory studying cold physiology, its effects on the brain and its effects the body. And over the years, I've always kept track of the literature in this area and indeed there have been some tremendous discoveries, both in animal models, so in rodents like mice and rats, but also in humans and today we're going to talk about both categoriesof studies and I'll be careful to point out when discoveries were made in animal models and when they were made in humans. A key point when thinking about the use of cold as a tool, and the key point is that you have a baseline levelof temperature that is varying, changing across the 24 hour cycle. So any use of deliberate cold exposure is going to be super imposed on that rhythm, that circadian rhythm, meaning that 24 hour rhythm. The basic contour of your circadian rhythm in temperatureis that approximately two hours before the time you wake up is your so-called temperature minimum. So your temperature minimum is a time within the 24 hour cycle when your body temperature is at its lowest. So if you normally wake up around 6:00 AM, your temperature minimum is probably about 4:00 AM. If you normally wake up at about 7:00 AM, your temperature minimum is probably about 5:00 AM. It's not exactly two hours before your wake up time, it's approximately two hours before your wake up time. Now, as you go from your temperature minimum to the time in which you're going to awake, your temperature is rising slightly. And then at the point where you wake up, your temperature starts to go up more sharply and will continue to go up into the earlyand sometimes even into the late afternoon. And then sometime in the late afternoon and evening, your temperature will start to decline. And indeed, as you approach sleep, your body temperature will drop by anywhere from one to three degrees. And in fact that decrease in core body temperature is important if not essential for getting intoand staying in deep sleep. So temperature rises with waking, that's easy to remember. It tends to continue to rise throughout the day and in the late afternoon and evening, your temperature WILL start to go down and the dropin temperature actually helps you access sleep. That background or what we call baseline circadian rhythmin core body temperature is important to remember because it helps us frame both the effectsof deliberate cold exposure and helps us frame when you might want to use deliberate cold exposurein order to access specific states. It also points to times within the 24 hour cyclewhen you might want to avoid using deliberate cold exposure, if your primary goal is to get to sleep.",2798.0,569.0,"The use of cold for health and performance has been studied in both animal models and humans. It's important to note that any deliberate cold exposure is superimposed on the circadian rhythm, which has a temperature minimum approximately two hours before waking up. As you wake up, your temperature rises slightly and continues to rise throughout the day, but in the late afternoon and evening, it starts to decline, which is important for accessing deep sleep. Deliberate cold exposure can be used to access specific states, but it's important to avoid it if your primary goal is to get to sleep.","What is the relationship between deliberate cold exposure and the circadian rhythm, and how can it affect sleep?

"Tool: Quickly Decrease Core Body Temperature, Glabrous Skin:","So that's the circadian rhythm in temperature. Now I just briefly want to touch on thermal regulation at the level of body and the brain. And this will be very surprising to many of you. Let's do what's called a Gedanken experiment, which is a thought experiment. Let's say I send you out into the desert heat for a jog or a run and it's very hot outside, 102 or 103 degrees, and you start to move, you start to sweat and of course your core body temperature goes up. Now, then I offer you a cold towel, maybe a really, really cold towel and this towel is saturated with water so you could actually squeeze the water out of that and cool your body off. And our Gedanken experiment is for me to say okay, where are you going to place the towel? How are you going to cool yourself off? And I'm guessing that most of you would think that the best way to cool yourself off would be to drape that towel over your head, maybe your neck, over your torso, that it would feel really, really good, and it would cool you off. Well, that's exactly the wrong approach if you want to cool off. And in fact, if you were to use that approach, your body temperature would continue to increase even more. Yes, even more than had you not placed that cold towel on your head or your torso. And here is why. Thermal regulation meaning your brain and body's ability to regulate your internal core temperature is somewhat like a thermostat and that thermostat resides in your brain. So if you think about the thermostat in your home or apartment, if it's too warm in your home or apartment and you were to take a bag of ice and to put it on that thermostat, what would the thermostat do? It would register the environment as artificially cool. It would think that the environment was actually much colder than it is. And so as a consequence, it would trigger a mechanism to further increase the temperature in the room. And you have such a thermostat as well. It's called the medial preoptic area of the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus is a small region of brain tissue about over the roof of your mouth and a little bit in front of that. So it's basically right behind your nose and over the roof of your mouth and it's a collection of neurons. Those neurons have a lot of different functions that include things like the control of aggression, the control of sex behavior, the control of temperature regulation and so on. The medial preoptic area has connections with the rest of the brain or areas within the brain, I should say and with many areas within the body, it receives input from receptors in our skin and inside our body that register temperature and it acts as a thermostat. So if the surface of your body is made cool, your medial preoptic area will send signals by way of hormones and by way of chemicals that will serve to heat your body up. So what this means is that if you want to cool down, the last thing you want to do is to bring a cold surface of any kind, towel or splashing water, to the majority of your body surface. It might be very, very surprising to you. And you might say, wait, if I want to cool down, I should jump into a cold lake or something of that sort. That's a different thing altogether.",3195.0,694.0,"Andrew huberman explains how the thermal regulation works by drawing on an example of a person in the sahara. That person, if they are struck by hyperthermia, i.e. that their body is to hot for their body to control, it is not best practice to put a cold towel on their body, rather, putting some semi-hot water or just somewhat colder than the surrondings so your body can naturally and gradually cool down. This is because the body will upon exposure to cold water believe that it should heat the body further, rather than cool down, thereby, do not put cold water on a very hot body.

The brain centers triggering this is the meidal preoptic area of the hyperthalamus, the body's thermostat.","How would the body react to getting cold water on it in a situation where its very hot, according to Huberman?",Cold Exposure,Andrew Huberman,0,1685321333
"What I'll tell you, and we'll get into this in more depth later, is that if you really want to cool down quickly and efficiently, you should leverage particular portals, meaning particular sites on your bodywhere heat can leave your body more readily and where cooling can have a dramatic and fast impacton your core body temperature, can even save your life if you're going hyperthermic.","We're going to talk more about the specific protocols to reducecore body temperature for sake of performance and avoiding hyperthermia later in the episode. Hyperthermia of course is a very, very dangerous situationbecause while your body can drop in core temperature somewhat and still be safe, you can't really increase your body temperature that much before your brain starts to cook and other organs start to cook and by cook, I mean the cells actually start to die. So you have to be very, very careful with the use of heat. Heat stroke is no joke. People die from heat stroke all the time. You really want to avoid that. One way to avoid that is to cool the appropriate surfacesof your body and the appropriate surfaces in this case are the upper cheeksor I would say the upper half of the face, the palms of your hands and the bottoms of your feet. I've talked about this on the podcast beforeand in the guest episode with Dr. Craig Heller, my colleague in the biology department at Stanford, but just very briefly, these surfaces, the upper half of the face, the palms of the hands and the bottoms of the feetare what we call glabrous skin surfaces, G-L-A-B-R-O-U-S, glabrous. And those surfaces are unique in that just below them, the vasculature is different than elsewhere in the body. Normally the passage of blood goes from arteries to capillaries to veins, but just beneath the glabrous skin on the bottomsof the feet, the hands in the upper half of the face, you have what are called arterio-venous anastomoses. These are portals of blood that go directly from arteries to veins and in doing so, allow the body to dump heat more readily, more quickly. So as it turns out that if you are to cool the palms of the hands, the bottoms of the feet and the upper half of the face, you can more efficiently reduce core body temperature for sake of offsetting hyperthermiaand for improving athletic performance and maybe even cognitive performance. So we will return to the specific protocolsfor doing that later in the episode, I'll give you a lot of details about how to do that, how to do that without the use ofany fancy or expensive technology. There are some technologies that are now commercially available, for instance, the so-called CoolMitt that will allow you to do that with maximum efficiency, but I'll also give you some at home methods to do thiseither in the gym or on runs or for sake of cognitive work. So the two key themes againare understand that baseline circadian rhythm in temperature, and understand that the best way to coolthe body is going to be by making sure that something cold contactsthe bottoms of your feet, the palms of your hands and the upper half of the face. Ideally all three if your goal is to lower core body temperature quickly, and again, just cooling off the back of your neck or the top of your head or your torso with a towelis going to be the least efficient way to lower core body temperature and might even increasebody temperature under certain conditions. With those two points in mind, we can start to think about directed deliberate",3095.0,652.0,"The main takeaways from this lecture are that hyperthermia is a dangerous condition that can cause organ damage and even death, and cooling the appropriate surfaces of the body (upper cheeks, palms of hands, and bottoms of feet) can efficiently reduce core body temperature and improve athletic and cognitive performance. It is important to understand the baseline circadian rhythm in temperature and use methods that involve cold contact with these specific surfaces. Cooling off other parts of the body may not be as effective and could potentially increase body temperature.","What are the main takeaways from Andrew Huberman's lecture on hyperthermia and cooling techniques, and what specific body surfaces should be targeted for effective temperature reduction?",Cold Exposure,Andrew Huberman,1,1686068841
Mental Effects of Cold Exposure::,"Mental Effects of Cold Exposure: And I want to separate those out for you. There are cold protocols that have been testedin peer reviewed studies that are designed to improve mental performance. They are designed to improve things like resilienceor your grittiness, or your ability to move through challenge or to regulate your mind and your internal stateunder conditions of stress and we can define stress very specifically as timeswhen adrenaline also called epinephrine and or norepinephrine also called noradrenaline, are elevated in your body. Forgive me for the noradrenaline, norepinephrine, adrenaline, epinephrine nomenclature, I didn't make that up. It turns out that every once in a while, scientists disagree, imagine that, and you'll get multiple scientistsnaming the same molecule different things. So epinephrine and adrenaline are the same thing. I will use them interchangeably. Norepinephrine and noradrenaline are the same thing. I will use those terms interchangeably. Noradrenaline and adrenaline are often co-released in the brain and body. So they work as kind of a pair to increaseour level of agitation, our level of focus and our desire and our ability to move. They are often co-released from different sites in the brain and body with dopamine, a molecule that is commonly misunderstood as the molecule of pleasure, but is actually the molecule of motivation, reward and pursuit. So dopamine, norepinephrine and noradrenalinetend to be released together under certain conditions and today you'll learn how deliberate cold exposurecan be used to cause increases in the release of several, if not, all of these in waysthat can improve your levels of attention and your mood. But the key point is that your mental state is shiftedwhen you are exposed to certain forms of cold, and many people use deliberate cold exposurespecifically to shift their body state as a way to train their mental state so that they can better copewith stress in real life and by real life, I mean when life presents stressful events, and I will give you specific protocols as to how you can do that, in other words, how you can become more resilientthrough the use of deliberate cold exposure. Now, because of the ways in which deliberate cold exposurecan increase this category of chemicals called the catecholamines, that includes dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine, it can also be used to elevate mood for long periods of time. And I'm going to discuss a specific protocolthat has been shown to increase these chemicals anywhere from 2. 5X to 250%, to as high as 500%, five times over baseline. Now you might be asking whether or not it is a good thingto raise chemicals like norepinephrine and dopamine to such a great degree, whether or not that's healthy for us, whether or not they can harm us. But it turns out that these elevations in norepinephrine and dopamine are very long lasting in waysthat people report feeling vast improvements in mood and vast improvementsin levels of cognitive attention and energy. So by my read of the literature, these seem to be healthy increases in our baseline levels of these chemicals in ways that can really support usso I'll give you a protocol for that. Now, those are some of the mental effects of deliberate cold exposure,",3282.0,696.0,"Deliberate cold exposure can improve mental performance by increasing resilience, grittiness, and the ability to regulate the mind and internal state under stress. This is achieved by elevating the levels of catecholamines, including dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine, which are released together under certain conditions. Cold exposure can also elevate mood for long periods of time, with some protocols increasing these chemicals up to 500% over baseline. These increases are considered healthy and can support mental and cognitive function.","What are the benefits of deliberate cold exposure on mental performance, and how does it achieve these benefits according to Andrew Huberman?",Cold Exposure,Andrew Huberman,1,1686068853
Physical Effects of Cold Exposure:,"but deliberate cold exposure has also been studied in animal models and in humans in the context of increasing metabolism, even in converting certain fat cells that we call white fat cells, which are the ones where energy is stored, they're the ones that we typically think of as kind of blubbery fat, to beige or brown fat, which is thermogenic fat, meaning that it can increase core body temperature and serves kind of the furnaceby which we increase our core metabolism. So with a very broad stroke, I can say that white fat is generally the kind of fat that people want less of and beige fat and brown fatis generally the kind of fat that if you're going to have fat cells and you certainly need fat cells that you want more of. They are thermogenic, they help you stay lean. They actually serve as a reservoir for heating your body up if you're ever confronted with a cold challenge. So we're going to talk about how to use cold for metabolism as well. And of course, people are using deliberate cold exposureto reduce inflammation post exercise, to reduce inflammation generally. And people are also using cold to enhance performancein the context of strength training, in the context of endurance training and we'll talk about those data as well,",1253.0,252.0,"Deliberate cold exposure has been studied in animals and humans to increase metabolism by converting white fat cells to beige or brown fat, which is thermogenic and helps increase core body temperature.

How Cold Should the Temperature Be?:,"but where I'd like to start is with mental performance and I'd like to detail what happenswhen we deliberately expose ourselves to cold. It's key to point out the word deliberate. If I don't say otherwise, then throughout this episode, if I say cold exposure, I mean deliberate cold exposure. And the reason I point that out is that as my colleague, David Spiegel, and the department of psychiatry at Stanford says, it's not just about the state that we are in, it's about the state that we are in and whether or not we had anything to with placing ourselves into that stateand whether or not we did that on purpose or not. And what he really means by that statement is thatthere are important effects of what we call mindset. Mindset was a topic discussed in the guest episodewith Ali Crumb some weeks ago. If you haven't seen that episode, I highly recommend it. And the science of my mindset tells us that if we are doingsomething deliberately and we believe that it's going to be good for us, it actually can lead to a different setof physiological effects than if something is happening to us against our will or without our control. Now, this is different than placebo effects. Placebo effects are distinct from mindset effects. If you want to learn more about that distinction, please see the episode with Ali Crumb. But again, when I talk about cold exposure in this episode, I'm talking about deliberate cold exposure, meaning that you are placing yourself into acold environment on purpose in order to extract a particular set of benefits. When we talk about deliberate cold exposure, almost always, that means getting uncomfortable. And one of the most common questions I get when discussing the use of cold for sake of mental or physical performance, metabolism, et cetera, is how cold should it be? How cold should the water be? How cold should the environment be?And I just will tell you now and I'm going to say this again and again throughout the episode, cause it will continue to be true throughout the episodeand long after the episode is over, how cold depends on your cold tolerance, your core metabolism, and a number of other features that there is simply no wayI could know or have access to. So I would like you to use this rule of thumb. If you are using deliberate cold exposure, the environment that you place yourself intoshould place your mind into a state of whoa, I would really like to get out of this environment, but I can stay in safely. Now that might seem a little bit arbitrary, but let's say you were to get into a warm showerand it would feel really, really nice and you were to start turning down the warm and turning up the cold. There would be some threshold at whichit would feel uncomfortable to you. And if you were to continue to make a little bit colder than that, you would really want to get out of the shower, but you are confident that you could stay in without risking your health, without risking a heart attack. Now that's very different than jumping into a very, very cold lake orI've seen these images of people that will cut holes into frozen over lakes and they'll get into that cold water. If you are trained to do that and you have the right conditions, et cetera, that can be done reasonably safely, but that's certainly not what I would start with. And for many people, that would be too cold and indeed some people can go into cold shockand can die as a consequence of getting to that extremely cold water very quickly. Now that's not to scare you away from deliberate cold exposure. It's just to say that there's no simple prescriptive of how cold to make environment in order to extract maximum benefitfor mental or physical performance. So the simple rule of thumb is going to beplace yourself into an environment that is uncomfortably cold, but that you can stay in safely. And you'll have to experiment a bit and that number, meaning that temperature, will vary from day to day. It will vary across the 24 hour cyclebecause of that endogenous, meaning that internal rhythm, in temperature that I talked about earlier. Low early in the day, rises into the afternoon, drops at night. You can actually do this experiment if you like. Try getting into a cold shower at 11 o'clock at night if you want versus try doing itin the middle of the afternoon. It's quite a different experience and by quite a different experience, I mean it requires quite a different degree of resilience and leaning into the practice. Your willpower will have to be higher I suspect late in the day as it compared to early in the day, but that will vary of course between individuals as well. So the most common question I get about deliberate cold exposureis how cold should the water be? And we've answered that with uncomfortably cold to the pointwhere you want to get out, but you can safely stay in. The second most common question I get about deliberate cold exposure is whether or not",4934.0,1030.0,,"What is the key point that Andrew Huberman makes about deliberate cold exposure and mindset, and how does this affect the physiological effects of cold exposure?",Cold Exposure,Andrew Huberman,0,0
Cold Showers vs. Cold Water Immersion:,"cold showers are as good, better or worse than cold water immersion up to the neck, for instance. I also get a lot of questions about whether or not cryo chambers are better than all the others, et cetera, et cetera. I'm going to make all of that very simple for you by saying cold water immersion up to the neck with your feet and hands submerged alsois going to be the most effective. Second best would be cold shower. Third best would be to go outside with a minimum amount of clothing, but of course, clothing that is culturally appropriate and that would allow you to experience cold to the pointwhere you would almost want to shiver or start shivering. Now there are a number of different, important constraints that are going to dictatewhether or not you use one form of cold exposure or the other. For instance, some people don't have access to cold water immersion. They don't have access to ice baths or cold water tanks, cold ocean or cold lakes, et cetera. In that case, showers would be the next best solution. I do want to emphasize that there have been very few, if any, studies of cold showers, and you can imagine why this would be the case. In a laboratory, you want to control for as many variables as possible. So placing people into a cold water immersion or an ice bathup to the neck and insisting they keep their hands and feet under is very easy to control. It means that everyone can do essentially the same thing whereas with cold showers, people are different sized bodies. Some people are going to put their head under. Some people are going to lean forward. Measuring the amount of cold water exposure on the bodyis very hard to do and so there aren't a lot of studies of cold showers, but of course, a lot of people don't have access to cold water immersion so they have to use cold showers. And if you don't have access to both, of course, then going outside on a cold day can be of a benefit. But I will point out that the heat transferfrom your body into water is much higher, four times greater, if not even greater, depending on the temperature of the water, in water as opposed to in air. So it's going to be much more efficientto do cold water immersion than anything else, cold showers after that and put yourself into a cold environment would be the third best thing. I'm not going to get into cryo chambers because they carry quite a high degree of cost. And again, there aren't many studies of them. So if you have access to cryo chambers, I'm sure that the cryo chamber facility has told you about all these incredible benefitsand I don't doubt that some of those benefits truly exist, but most people just don't have the resources or the access to thoseso we're going to leave cryo chambers out of today's discussion. And of course I realize there's a fourth category of cold exposure out there. People are wearing ice vests. Believe it or not, those exist, ice underwear. Yes, those exist. You can look for them on Amazon if you like. They are putting cold packs in their armpitsor in their groin or elsewhere in order to stimulate some of the effects of coldon mental and physical performance. I'm not going to address those in too much detail today. They can be efficient in certain ways, but as you'll learn about later in the episode, cooling the palms, the upper faceand the bottoms of the feet is going to be far more efficient and unfortunately I think most of the people that are usingice packs to increase their core metabolism are not aware of the glabrous skin coolingand how it can be a very, very potent stimulus so we'll return to that later. Unless I say otherwise, I'm mainly going to be focusing on cold water immersion and cold showers. So let's talk about protocols for enhancing mental health",3756.0,806.0,"Cold water immersion up to the neck with hands and feet submerged is the most effective form of cold exposure, followed by cold showers and going outside with minimal clothing. Cold showers have not been extensively studied, but are a good alternative for those without access to cold water immersion. Cryo chambers are expensive and have limited studies, so they are not discussed. Ice vests and packs can be efficient, but cooling the palms, upper face, and bottoms of the feet is more effective. The focus will mainly be on cold water immersion and cold showers for enhancing mental health.","What are the most effective forms of cold exposure for enhancing mental health, according to Andrew Huberman, and how do they compare to cryo chambers and ice vests?",Cold Exposure,Andrew Huberman,1,1686069115
Protocols for Cold Exposure:,"and performance using deliberate cold exposure. What happens when we get into cold is that we experiencean increase in norepinephrine, in noradrenaline release and in adrenaline release. The fact that cold exposure, deliberate or no, increases norepinephrine and epinephrinein our brain and body means that it is a very reliable stimulus for increasing norepinephrine and epinephrine. That's sort of an obvious statement, but that obvious statement can be leveragedto systematically build up what we call resilience. Now, when we experience a stressor in life, whether or not it's something bad happens in our relationship or something bad happens in the worldand we feel stress, that stress is the consequence of increases in norepinephrine and epinephrine in our brain and body. Very similar, if not identical, to the kinds of increases that come from deliberate cold exposure. So deliberate cold exposure is an opportunity to deliberately stress our body and yet, because it's deliberate and because we can take certain steps, which I'll describe in a moment, we can learn to maintain mental clarity, we can learn to maintain calm while our body is in a state of stress. And that can be immensely useful when encountering stressors in other parts of life. And that's what we call resilience or grit, our ability or mental toughness, our ability to lean into challenge or to tolerate challengewhile keeping our heads straight, so to speak. So one simple protocol for increasing resilienceis to pick a temperature that's uncomfortable of shower or cold immersion, and then to get in for a certain duration of timeand then to get out. Now, it's important to understand that people will experience different levels of norepinephrine and adrenaline releasewhen getting into cold water. Some people, because they dread the cold so much, will actually experience norepinephrine and epinephrine increases even before they get into the cold wateror under the cold shower. Now you may have experienced this. I've certainly experienced this. I'm dreading it, I don't want to do itand I have to force myself to do it. And indeed epinephrine and norepinephrine and its surgescan be thought of as sort of walls that we have to confront and go over. And I'd like you to conceptualize them that way, because it allows us to build protocols that can be very objective and can allow usto monitor our progress in terms of building resilience. So one option is to simply say, okay, I'm going to force myself to get into the cold shower for one minute. How cold, again, uncomfortably cold, but you can stay in safely or I'm going to get into the ice bath for one minute. Ice baths are very cold inevitably. And what is also inevitable is that when you get into the cold, you will experience a surgein epinephrine and norepinephrine. That's non-negotiable because it's mediated by cold receptors on the surface of your bodyand your skin and the way that they trigger the release of norepinephrine and epinephrine, not just from the adrenals, from the adrenal glands above your kidneys, but also from regions of your brain, like the locus coeruleus, which cause increases in the tension and alertness, and from other locations in your body where epinephrine and norepinephrine are released. In other words, cold is a non-negotiable stimulusfor increasing epinephrine and norepinephrine. Even if you are the toughest person in the worldand you love the cold, that increase in epinephrine and norepinephrine is going to happen. So the way to think about norepinephrine and epinephrine in this context of building mental resilienceis that you have two options. You can either try to extend the duration of timethat you are in the deliberate cold exposure. So going from one minute to 75 seconds to two minutesand so on over a period of days or one way to approach this and the way that I particularly favoris to take the context of the day and the moment into account, meaning we have different levels of grit and resilienceon different days and depending on the landscape of our life at the time, even the time of day that we're doing these protocolsand start to be able to sense the release of epinephrine, and norepinephrine in our brain and body and see those as walls that we want to climb over in order to build resilience and to start countingthe number of walls that we traverse and the distance between those walls as we do deliberate cold exposure. Let me give you an example of the timed protocol because that one is very straightforward, although I do not think it is as powerful for building mental resilience. The time protocol would be Monday, I do one minute of deliberate cold exposure at a given temperature. Wednesday, I extend that by 50% and Friday, I do deliberate cold exposure for twice as long as I did it on Monday. And if I were to continue that every week, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, I would continue to either increase the duration or I would lower the temperature and reduce the duration, this kind of thing, very much like sets and reps in the gym. Now that option is very objective. You could even log it in a bookand as you develop the ability to stay in cold temperatures, even progressively colder and colder temperatures for longer and longer periods of time, you will become more resilient. What do I mean by that? Well, my operational definition of resilience is that you are able to resist escape from the stressor, the cold, by virtue of your willpower, which is really your prefrontal cortexcausing top down control on your reflexes and your limbic system and your hypothalamus, which are basically telling you to get out of that cold water, get out of that cold environment and in doing so, you are basically getting better at controlling your behavior when your brain and body are flooded with norepinephrine and epinephrine. That's a very reductionist way to explain resilience or grit or mental toughness, but it's a reductionist way of explaining itthat is very closely tied to the biology end of the psychology. And it is a fact that norepinephrine and epinephrinerelease in the brain and body are the generic universal code for stressor. There is no unique chemical signature for different forms of stressors, that is the only one, although of course there areother chemicals involved as well. So you could go for time and you could try and reduce the temperature and increase the timeover a period of days or weeks. Now that's an attractive way to approach things, but the problem is that you don't have an infinite amountof room with which to lower temperature, because eventually you will get into temperatures that are either so cold that they are dangerousor you have to stay in cold temperatures for such long periods that it becomes impracticalbecause presumably you also have to take care of other aspects of your life, you can't just sit all day in the ice bath. Now for that reason, I favor a protocol in which you build mental resilience and mental toughness throughtwo different types of protocols. The first one involves counting walls. Now, what do I mean by walls? I mean the sensation of, no, I don't want to do this and the idea or the sensation in your brain and body that you actually want to leavethat environment and go warm up. Now again, for some people, that will be even before getting into the ice bathor cold shower. So if you are feeling very resistant to getting into the ice bath or cold shower and you manage to do that, that's going over what I would call one wall. Then for some period of time, you might actually feel comfortable in the ice bath, cold water or cold shower. And you feel like you could stay there for some period of time, that you could stay there for a minute or two minutes, but inevitably, the next wall will arrive. And I would encourage you to pay attention to when that next wall arrives and actually having an awareness, that so-called interceptive awareness as we call it, of when that next surge adrenaline epinephrine comesor whether or not it reaches a certain threshold in your brain and body that you feel you want to get out and you're able to stay in for even just 10 seconds longer, that means you've traversed yet another wall. And if you continue to stay in that cold environment, you'll find that the next wall will come and the next wall will come. Now eventually of course, you will get very, very numbdepending on how cold it is and you could also place yourself into danger. So you have to maintain cognitive control, counting these walls, traversing these walls, but getting out at some point, of course. So my favorite protocol for building mental toughness AKA grit, AKA resilience, is to take into account that some days, just getting into the ice bath or cold shower represents a wall, some days it doesn't. Some days you get in and you feel you could go 10 minutes, other days you get in and you feel like you could only go a minute and setting a designated numberof walls before you start the protocol is going to be very beneficial here. So you say, as long as I can do it safely, I'm going to do three walls today. The first wall is getting in. The second wall will arrive when it arrivesand the third wall will arrive when it arrives and I'll get over that wall and then I'll get out. The next day, you might do five walls. The next day, you might do three walls again, but you might lower the temperature. This gives you tremendous flexibilityand indeed it gives you much more latitude to be able to use the same temperatures in different ways, or to reduce the temperature only a little bit and still get a lot of stimulus, meaning a lot of results out of a given protocol. Whereas people who are just going for temperature and time eventually become cold adapted. They get very, very good at doing three minutesor six minutes or even 10 minutes at a given temperature and so then they feel like they have to lower the temperature even more and even moreand eventually they just bought them out. There's nowhere else to go. There's no way to get improvements out of the protocol. At least not in terms of mental resilience. Of course, there's still the positive effectson inflammation and metabolism, et cetera, that we'll talk about in a little bit. But the key thing here is to design protocolsthat are going to work for you over time and for you very, very hardy, very, very tough guys and gals out therethat can get right into an ice bath or a very, very cold immersion and you can just grind it out for six or 10 minutes, or you can even do that by remaining peaceful, well more points to you, but guess what?That's the equivalent of already having loaded up the barbell with 600 pounds and done your 10 reps. There's not a whole lot more variable space with which to get benefits from that stimulus. And in the weight room, people understand that you can adjust, for instance, the speed of the movement, or you can start combining that movementwith pre-exhaustion, et cetera. With cold exposure, you don't have as much variable space to play with. So if your goal is to build resilience, either go for time as a function of temperature, or what I suggest is to start recognizing these wallsas an experience of resistance in you and going over those walls, set a certain number of wallsthat you're going to go over on a given day and do that at a given temperature, and then to mix it up. And ideally you might even throw in one more wall at the end, if you're really feeling bold and bravebecause that's going to build out further resilience. But if you want cold exposure to work for you for sake of building up resilienceand mental toughness over time, you're going to want to vary this parameter space in some sort of way. And you don't have to be super systematic about it. That's the beauty of this kind of approachbecause you're relying on the fact that those walls really represent times in which you are forcing your top down control, your prefrontal cortex to clamp down on your reflex and you're learning behavioral control in the contextof your body having elevated levels of these catecholamines, norepinephrine and epinephrine. And that translates to real lifein a much more realistic way I believe because in real life, you're not really engaging in stressorsfor a given amount of time that you know how long it's going to last and you know the context, no. Most stressors arrive in the form of surprises we don't like, text messages that deliver bad news, information about the outside world or real world and online interactions that send our systeminto a state of increased norepinephrine and epinephrine. And if you start to think of those as walls that you can tolerate and climb overwhile staying and calm and clear of mind, then you can really imagine how the ice bathand other forms of cold exposure are really serving to train you up for real life stressors.",12897.0,2773.0,"Deliberate cold exposure can increase norepinephrine and epinephrine in the brain and body, which can be leveraged to build resilience and mental toughness. One protocol for increasing resilience is to pick an uncomfortable temperature for a cold shower or immersion and gradually increase the duration over time. However, this approach has limitations as there is only so much room to lower the temperature or increase the duration. A more effective approach is to recognize the walls of resistance that arise during cold exposure and set a designated number of walls to overcome each day. This approach allows for more flexibility and variability in the protocol. The goal is to build behavioral control in the context of elevated levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine, which can translate to real-life stressors. It is important to maintain cognitive control and not place oneself in danger during cold exposure.","What is the recommended approach for increasing resilience through deliberate cold exposure, according to Andrew Huberman, and what precautions should be taken?",Cold Exposure,Andrew Huberman,20,1686069133
Optimal Mindset(s) During Cold Exposure:,"The next question that I always get is what should my mental state be while I'm exposing myself to this uncomfortable, yet safe condition of cold? Well, you have two options and there are probably other options as well. One is to try and calm yourself to remain as mentally still as possible. The other is to lean into that challenge and so to grind it out and here, I have to say that this is a lot like teaching someone to drive on a gravel road. For any of you that have driven on a gravel road, you know that there is no optimal speed for all gravel roads. It depends on the density of the gravel, et cetera, and the vehicle, et cetera. So for instance, on some gravel roads, when you start to drive and the dust starts to kick up, your best option is to drive fast and put that dust cloud behind you. On other gravel roads, if you try and do that, the dust actually kicks up around the vehicle and it makes it hard to see and sometimes you have to slow down. The same thing is true for getting throughdeliberate cold exposure. Sometimes it's easier to calm yourself. One way to do that is through double inhalesthrough the nose and extended exhales through the mouth, or simply by trying to control your breathingand reduce the pace of your breath and increase the volume of your breathing. I have to say that everyone experiences a shortening of breath when they get into uncomfortably cold water, that is a universal physiological response. Everyone also experiences a 30 to 80% decreasein cognitive function, in particular, the frontal cortex. The metabolism of your frontal cortex goes down, the metabolism meaning the activity of brain areas associated with stress and panic goes way up. And so anchoring your mind in cognitive activities as you get into the cold can be very, very helpful for maintaining clarity of mind. In fact, one thing that I sometimes recommendis that people try and engage in some sort of cognitive exercise while in the cold, not as a form of distraction, but as a way to maintain clarity of thinking and to learn how to do that when the body is flooded with all these chemicals that make us stressed. So for instance, you could do math problems and not two plus two equals four, not three times three equals nine, but things that require a little bit more focus and attention working memory and so forth. You could also start to have thoughts that you deliberately impose a full sentence structure on. That's actually quite tough. You could try and recall specific bouts of information that are challenging. This is teaching your mind how to stay online, or rather I should say, this is you teaching your prefrontal cortex, how to stay engaged while you have high levels of stress in your body. Years ago, I had a friend who worksin the neuroscience world, research neuroscientist, who was obsessed with this very bizarre sportthat I don't necessarily recommend at all, which is the combination of boxing and chess. You may have seen this on YouTubewhere people will box around, legitimate boxing around, they're sparring all out often. And then at the end of the round, instead of resting in the corner, they actually sit down and play chess, and then they go back to boxing and back to chess. Again, not a sport that I recommend, but the reason he was obsessed with this is because he studies the impact of stress on cognitive performance. And what that particular very bizarre sport was doing was toggling back and forth between different states of mind. Now it's used both to increase cognitive clarity for the fighter when they box, because staying calm and clear thinking is very important to winning boxing matches. Believe it or not, it's not an all outrage. It's a very calculated game of mental chess and physical chess that's quite high stakes as you can imagine. It's also used in some circles as a way to teach people how to engage in cognitive performancewhen their body is simply filled to a stress. So in the boxing chess example, the replacement for the cold water is actually the boxing, it's the thing that's supposed to induce the stress cause getting hit is stressful and the risk of getting hit is stressful for most people. So again, if you think about deliberate cold exposure as a way of just systematically and reliablyinducing epinephrine and norepinephrine release and delivering stress, well then this idea of maintaining cognitive clarityand actually engaging in cognitive tasks while in the ice bath or cold shower can actually be very beneficial. Even though it might sound a little bit silly, you are really training up your ability to keep your brain working when the reflex is to shut down the parts of your brainthat are involved in deliberate planning and thinking. Now another important aspect of deliberate cold exposure",4796.0,976.0,"is the importance of gradually increasing the intensity and duration of exposure. It's important to start with shorter exposures and gradually increase the time and intensity to avoid potential hazards such as hypothermia or frostbite. It's also important to listen to your body and not push yourself too far beyond your limits. Overall, deliberate cold exposure can have many benefits for physical and mental health, but it's important to approach it safely and with caution.","What are the potential hazards of deliberate cold exposure, and how can they be avoided according to Andrew Huberman?",Cold Exposure,Andrew Huberman,90,1686069152
Tool: Using Movement During Cold Exposure:,"that I rarely if ever hear discussed, but is vitally important is whether or notyou move around or not. And here's the reason. When you get into cold water and you remain therefor some period of time, your body is generating heat and that heat generates what's called a thermal layerthat surrounds your entire body. So if you stay still, you are actually warmer than if you move around, you can try this the next time you're doing your deliberate cold exposure. If you're submerged up to the neck, sit there for about 10, 30 seconds and be very, very still of body. In fact, this is the way that most people start to do deliberate cold exposure. They give this very stoic look. They don't blink, they look very peaceful. Some of them even look tough or they make a very even A, emotional faceand so it looks like they're really tough, but they are so still that believe it or not, they're not providing the most potent stimulus. If they or you were to move around in that water, what would happen is you'd break up the thermal layerand that you actually experience that as much colder. So if you really want to push the resilience aspect, or for instance, if you want to use a given temperature that you're comfortable in, but that you want to increase the stimulusand you want to get some more benefit for mental resilience training, well then get into the cold water, move your body around continuously, but try and keep your mind still, or even do some sort of cognitive task. So as you're starting to realize, there are a bunch of different variables that you can play with while maintaining the same temperature of water and in doing so, really keep you in the zone of what should and absolutely has to be safe for youwithout having to just continually drop the temperature from say 60 degrees to 55 to 40 to 33 because as I mentioned before, eventually you're going to bottom out. So if you're one of those people that likes to look tough or really relaxed while you're in the ice bathor cold water immersion, just realize that you're actually cheating yourself out of part of the stimulus. Keep those limbs moving and of course, limbs under the water, feet and handsis going to be a more potent stimulus than hands and feet out for reasons that should be obvious based on what we talked aboutin terms of glabrous skin cooling. Keep those submerged, move your body, maybe move your knees up and down, pedal your feet and trust me, it's going to feel a lot colder than were you to remain stone still.",2505.0,537.0,"When doing deliberate cold exposure, it is important to note that remaining still in cold water generates a thermal layer that surrounds the body, making you warmer than if you move around. However, moving around continuously in cold water breaks up the thermal layer and provides a more potent stimulus for mental resilience training. It is possible to play with different variables while maintaining the same temperature of water to keep yourself safe without continually dropping the temperature. Keeping limbs submerged and moving them around is more effective than keeping them out of the water.","What are the benefits of moving around continuously in cold water during deliberate cold exposure, according to Andrew Huberman?",Cold Exposure,Andrew Huberman,20,1686069161
Optimal Frequency of Cold Exposure:,"Another very common question is how often to do deliberate cold exposure. It's tough to make a recommendation on thatbased on any peer reviewed study although there are a few in humans that point to a thresholdof 11 minutes total per week. So that's total throughout the week divided into two or four sessionsof two or three minutes or so. Now that 11 minute cutoff is not a strict threshold and is actually geared more towards increases in metabolism, we'll get into this a little bit later in the episode, but I think the 11 minute threshold, meaning 11 minutes total of deliberate cold exposure per week is a pretty good number to useif you need a number in order to keep you consistent. But as we talked about earlier, some of you are going to be in the ice bathor cold immersion or cold shower for one minute, others of you will be in there for 10 minutes, depending on how frequent and how high, if you will, those walls of adrenaline are coming. So for some of you, getting into a cold shower for three minutes totalfor the whole week will represent a tremendous achievement in terms of willpower and overcomingthe resistance to doing that, overcoming those walls. For others of you, three minutes is nothing. So what do I recommend, I recommend that you get at least 11 minutes total per week, but at the point where 11 minutes total per weekis very easy for you, where is no longer representing a significant mental challenge, meaning you're not experiencing many of these walls, you're excited to get into the cold shower immersion, you're going through it easily, you're cruising basically. Then I would say either lower the temperature safely, of course, extend the duration safely, of course, or increase the frequency so that you're doing this perhaps every day or maybe five days a weekor three days a week. I personally get tremendous benefit from doing deliberate cold exposure three times a weekand using the walls method that I described earlier as my gauge for how long to stay in and typically that means that I'm staying in for anywherefrom two minutes to six minutes per session and that averages out to about11 to 15 minutes total per week. So again, I do not think that you need to be super strictabout these guidelines. It's most important when embracing a protocol A, that you do it safely, but secondarily that you do it consistently. So find what you can do consistently and then vary the parametersthat will allow you to continue to do deliberate cold exposure consistently, regardless of whether or not you have access to a showeror cold immersion, et cetera. So we've been talking about mental effects and the use of deliberate cold exposure",2673.0,549.0,"The recommended threshold for deliberate cold exposure is 11 minutes total per week, divided into two or four sessions of two or three minutes. This threshold is geared towards increasing metabolism. However, it's important to note that this is not a strict threshold and can vary depending on individual tolerance levels. It's recommended to start with 11 minutes per week and increase the duration, frequency, or lower the temperature as it becomes easier. Consistency is key, so find what works for you and stick to it. The mental benefits of deliberate cold exposure have been discussed. Safety is also important when practicing deliberate cold exposure.","What is the recommended threshold for deliberate cold exposure according to Andrew Huberman, and what should individuals do to increase the duration or frequency of exposure?",Cold Exposure,Andrew Huberman,100,1686069165
"Cold Exposure for Dopamine, Mood & Focus:","for sake of building resilience, which I do believe can be tremendously powerful. Look, it's no coincidence that the screeningand the training for Navy Seals involves a lot of exposure to cold water. One could argue that it is deliberate because they elect to go to buds, but when they get into the cold water at budsis dictated by the instructors and the reason they use cold water exposure as the stressoris that it does offer considerable leeway in terms of duration and temperature, in terms of how you can use it as a stressor whereas things like heat don't offer much variable spaceas we say. There isn't a lot of room beyond which you start injuring or even killing people by using heat. So there are a lot of forms of stressors out there, but cold is one that we can titrate, that we can adjust in ways that can allow usto continually build up and or maintain mental toughness. Now, deliberate cold exposure also has many effects on chemicals other than norepinephrine and epinephrine, most notably the neuromodulator dopamine, which is involved in elevating our mood, making us feel energized and enhancing our ability to focus. And that has a lot to do with how dopamine engages usin motivated states, tends to narrow our thinking in our behavior into a particular trench of goal-directed behavior. If you want to learn more about dopamine, you can learn a lot about dopamine in our episode about dopamine, it's at hubermanlab. com. You can find it, it's a two and a half hour plus kind of deep dive into all things dopamine, focus, motivation, et cetera. Deliberate cold exposure has a very powerful effecton the release of dopamine in our brain and body. And this is one of the main reasons why people continueto do deliberate cold exposure. Basically it makes us feel good and it continues to make us feel goodeven after we get out of the cold environment. In fact, some people would say they don't feel good in the cold environment, it's all stress for them, but afterwards they feel great. One of our previous guests, Dr. Anna Lembke, who's a medical doctor at Stanford University School of Medicine, she's a close colleague of mine, described the use dopamine in her book, Dopamine Nation, an incredible book about addiction and dopamine I should mention. And the use of dopamine elicited by cold water exposureby one of her patients. What I'm referring to is the fact that one of her patients helped themselves get and stay sober off drugsby using deliberate cold exposure to increase dopamine. So a healthier form of dopamine releasethan they were engaged in prior to getting sober. Now, the basis for dopamine releasein response to cold exposure is that the catecholamines, norepinephrine, epinephrine and dopamine tend to be co-releasedby the same sorts of stimuli, but most stressors and in particular things that evoke stress or our feelings of stress internallythat we don't like do not increase dopamine. They only increase norepinephrine and epinephrine, but deliberate cold exposure seems to cause a dramatic increase in dopamine. And this has actually been substantiated in a really beautiful study entitled human physiological responsesto immersion into water of different temperatures. The first author is Sramek. I'm almost certainly pronouncing that poorly and if not incorrectly, S-R-A-M-E-K. This was published in the European Journal of Applied Physiology in the year 2000, really a beautiful study, I love this study. They took people and they had them sit in chairs underwater but their head was out and so they were immersedup to the neck in either of three different temperatures. 32 degrees Celsius, which is 89 degrees Fahrenheit, 20 degrees Celsius, which is 68 degrees Fahrenheit, or 14 degrees Celsius, which is 57. 2 degrees Fahrenheit. So not super cold, but then what they didis they measured people's core body temperature throughout. They measured their metabolism and they looked at serum levelsof things like norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine, and cortisol, serum meaning within the blood. So a really nice and quite thorough study. There were not a huge number of subjects in the study, but nonetheless, it was a very thorough study in terms of the number of variables that they explored. So I just want to briefly highlight some of what they saw or what they observed in this study. First of all, all the groups were in the water of a given temperature for one hour, which is much longer than most of the deliberate cold exposure protocols that anyone is using at home. I mean, maybe you're taking one hour long cold showers, maybe you're getting into the ice bath for an hour although I don't recommend that. I think you'd probably get badly hypothermic or maybeyou're getting into a cold water immersion for some period of time, but I have a hard time imagining that it would be an hourand I don't suggest that if it's very cold. So this study focused on actually somewhat moderately cool temperatures, not what I think most people would consider very, very cold temperatures, but extended the duration for quite a while. So again, 32 degree Celsius, 20 degree Celsius or 14 degree Celsius. Here's what they observed. The group that was immersed up to the neck in 32 degrees Celsius, that is 89 degrees Fahrenheit, water did not experience a shift in metabolism nor a significant increase in dopamine, norepinephrine or these other catecholamines. The group that was in 20 degree Celsius, meaning 68 degree Fahrenheit, water for an hour experienced a 93% increasein metabolic rate, which is remarkable given that the water wasn't that coldand yet an hour is a pretty long time to be in there. And again, it speaks to the dramatic effectof heat transfer that water has, which I mentioned earlier, as opposed to being out in the air at 68 degrees, it would certainly not cause that increase in metabolic rate. The group that was at 14 degrees Celsius, meaning 57. 2 degrees Fahrenheit, water for an hour experienced a 350% increase in metabolism. So huge increases in metabolism. Now the most interesting data to me, at least in terms of mental effects of deliberate cold exposure, were that the plasma or serum levels of norepinephrinein the blood increased 530%. These are huge increases in norepinephrineso it suggests that this is a stressful stimulus at least neurochemically speaking, stressful, despite the fact that it's not super super cold, although 57. 2 degrees Fahrenheit, 14 degrees Celsius it's not a warm environment, but it's not a ultra, ultra cold environment, but an hour is a very long time to be in there. The subjects also experienced a 250% increasein dopamine concentrations, which while not 530% as it was with norepinephrineis still a very large increase in baseline levels of dopamine. And what was interesting is that those increases in dopaminepersisted for a very long period of time afterwards, even out to two hours. And they stopped the study after 120 minutes of getting out of the cold, but nonetheless, these increases in norepinephrine are huge and long lasting and these increases in dopamineare very large and long lasting. And I do believe that these documented effects in humansexplain much of the enhancement of attention and of feelings of wellbeing and mood that people typically experienceafter doing deliberate cold exposure. And the reason I say that is thatif you were to go back to the episode that I did on dopamine, or you were to go back to the episode that I did with Dr. Anna Lembke on addiction and dopamine, what you would find is that increases in dopamine of the sort evoked by deliberate cold exposureare actually very similar to the kinds of increases in dopamine that are elicited by things like nicotineor from other behaviors that are known to be addictive and bad for us because they lead to other effects on the brainand body that we simply don't want. And yet deliberate cold exposure provided is done safelycan create similar if not greater increases in dopamine that are not just fleeting, that don't just occur during, say the consumption of some deleterious drug or activity, but that are very long lasting and that can be leveragedtoward activities other than deliberate cold exposure. So I want to emphasize this. I'm not suggesting that people do deliberate cold exposure for an hour a day. And unfortunately there are not many studies yetexploring how shorter colder temperature environment exposure, say one minute or three minutesor six minutes at 55 degrees or at 50 degrees, whether or not that leads to similar, greater or reduced levels of dopamine in the brain and body. And yet almost everybody who does deliberate cold exposure will say yeah, it was stressful. I didn't enjoy it, or I eventually grew to like it, but that I always feel better afterwardsand then that feeling last a very long period of time. And I think it's almost certain that those experiences that people reportrelate to these increases in dopamine and in concert with the increases in norepinephrinealso explain the other effect that's commonly reported, which is an enhancement in mental acuity and the ability to focus. Now, here we can extrapolate to the study that I discussed at the early part of the episode, where I was talking about the use of short 15 minute exercise, kind of moderate intensity exercise and how that was shown to increase levels of energyand mental acuity in these working memory, visual attention tasks. And there, again, we have to assume somewhatbecause they weren't doing neurochemical measurements, but we can reasonably assume that those improvementsin cognitive performance were due at least in part to the increase in catecholamines known to a company, moderate intensity zone two cardio. So what you're starting to see here is a theme. The theme is that virtually any stimulusthat delivers more norepinephrine, epinephrine and dopamine to our system will sharpen our mental acuity and elevate our moodand will do so for some period of time. Deliberate cold exposure, it turns out, is a very potent way to increase these catecholamines, this category of chemicals and thereby to improve mood, mental acuity and levels of alertness. And as we'll next see, it not only has that effect, which can be very beneficial for many peoplein a bunch of different circumstances, but it also has the positive effects that many people seekin terms of metabolism, in lowering inflammation in the body and other physiological effects as well. And forgive me, I was almost ready to move on to effects of deliberate cold exposure on metabolismand inflammation and so forth, but I neglected to point out one of the other very interesting aspects of the studyshowing deliberate cold exposure can increase in norepinephrine and dopamine, which is that they observed no significant increasesin the stress hormone cortisol and that is both surprising, interesting, and importantbecause what it means is that the quality of stress that deliberate cold exposure is creating in the bodyis likely to be one of what we call use stress. Hans Selye, the great physiologist, won a Nobel Prize for distinguishing between distress, which is stress in the brain and bodythat causes the release of things like cortisol along with the other catecholamines, and that we experience as negative happening to usand can lead to negative health outcomes. And he distinguished that from eustress, which was stress that we now understandis associated with increases in things like norepinephrine and dopamine, but no increases or minimal increasesin cortisol, and that can lead to positive health outcomes. So it appears that deliberate cold exposure can createwhat we call or what Hans Selye called eustress. In other words, it can create a condition in the brainand body in which we are stressing ourselves, we are training up resilience, and yet we are creating a neurochemical milieuthat actually has many health benefits. Now I'd like to shift our attention to the effects of deliberate cold exposure on metabolism.",12022.0,2506.0,,"What are the effects of deliberate cold exposure on dopamine and norepinephrine levels in the body, and how do these effects relate to mental acuity and mood, according to Andrew Huberman?",Cold Exposure,Andrew Huberman,0,0
"Cold Exposure & Metabolism, Brown Fat:","And I'd like to start by detailing a study that was performed on humans and published just at the end of last year. The title of the study is altered brown fat thermoregulation, and enhanced cold induced thermogenesisin young, healthy winter swimming men. And I should point out that while the study was only performed on male subjects, there's no reason to think that the effects that they discovered would only pertain to men. I would hope that they would also do a study on womenat some point in the future, but the effects that they describe are very basic core physiological processes. What they did is they looked at at deliberate cold exposure in this group of young men, and they used that 11 minute threshold per week. So in other words, they had them get into cold water for approximately 11 minutes per week. And again, that's 11 minutes total per week. They divided that into two sessionsalthough in speaking with the first author of this study, Dr. Susanna Søberg, I learned that it probably is not importantthat it be two sessions, it could be three or even four sessions, as long as it reaches that 11 minute threshold. What they discovered was that by going into these cold environments, in this case cold water immersion up to the neck, for 11 minutes total per week, that these men experienced increasesin so-called brown fat thermogenesis, I'll talk more about what that is in a moment, and increases in core body temperaturethat translate to increases in core body metabolism. Now, the overall increases in core body metabolismthat they experienced were not extremely large. They were statistically significant, but they weren't extremely large. However, the changes in brown fat storesare perhaps what's most interesting about this study and I'll tell you why. The metabolic increases of deliberate cold exposureare both acute meaning happening in the short term. When you get into the cold and immediately after, one does experience an increase in core metabolism, you burn some calories, in other words, and while those might not be very significant increases, or I should say they can be statistically significant, but they are not enormously large numbers of calories burned, the longer lasting effects of deliberate cold exposureon metabolism seem to take place by changes that occur in the types of fat that we store in our bodyand the way that that fat impacts our metabolism at other times throughout the 24 hour cycle. This actually has a somewhat anecdotal basis, in particular in Scandinavia. I don't speak Swedish nor I speak Danish, nor do I speak Norwegian, but I do have Danish relativesand they were able to help me decipher a common Swedish saying, which essentially translates to the fact that in preparation for the summer, they say, one should expose themselves to warm environments so that one is comfortable in warm environmentsin the summer. That's one half of this traditional Swedish and also Danish saying. The other half of this traditional Danish-Swedish saying is that in preparation for winter, in order to not feel too cold in cold environments, one should prepare for those in the fallby not wearing a jacket and exposing one's self to cold environments. Now, of course, this is just anecdotal cultural lore, but it actually has a physiological basis, which is by exposing oneself to cold environmentson a repeated basis in anticipation of exposure to more extreme cold environments, one can feel more comfortable in those extreme cold environments. And that's exactly what they observedin this study by Søberg et al. The men felt more comfortable in extreme coldif they had trained through deliberate cold exposure, which might not seem surprising at all, but based on what we talked about earlier, whereby deliberate cold exposure evokes this discomfortand this experience of norepinephrine release, at least in the short term, then you would say, well, shouldn't that deliberate cold exposure also make them feel uncomfortable like they really want to get out? Well, that is truein the beginning of a deliberate cold exposure protocol, meaning in the first week or in the second weekor the third week, but what one finds and what you will find if you do deliberate cold exposure consistently is that you will thenbecome more comfortable at cold temperatures away from the deliberate cold exposure. So whereas you might have previously been the person who is always cold in the room with air conditioning, or always seeking a sweater, always wanting to bundle up, you will be more comfortable in those cold environments. And the reason for that is well substantiatedfrom this study and from animal studies whereby deliberate cold exposureconverts one particular kind of fat cell, the white fat cell, which is a very low metabolic output cell. It's basically a storage site for energy in the body fat cells to a different type of fat cell, which is the beige fat cell called beige because it's actually beige or slightly brownunder the microscope, or even to brown fat cells, which are very dark under the microscope and darkbecause they contain mitochondria and are very metabolically and thermogenetically active. In other words, white fat doesn't burn many calories. It's basically a storage site. It's a bank account for energy. It's filled with lipids, and those lipids can be used if the body needs energyand if it goes into a caloric deficit. Beige fat and brown fat acts as sort of a furnaceor the sort of fat that you would find in a kindle, a fuel that can increase core body temperature. So beige fat and brown fat is very good at raising our metabolism and helps burn white fat. Now of course, it does that only in the context of a caloric deficit, but it can actually help create that caloric deficit. Having more beige fat and brown fatcan increase your overall core metabolism, in other words, the number of calories that you burn per day, and therefore the number of calories that you need to either maintain or to lose weight. The simple translation of this is that getting into cold water for a total of 11 minutes, perhaps more, but at least 11 minutes per week divided into two or four sessions can increase your core metabolism in partby increasing your beige and brown fat stores. And we know how that works at least in animal modelsand there's now reason to suspect that the exact same mechanisms are occurring in humans. The primary way in which deliberate cold exposure convertswhite fat cells into these more metabolically thermogenetically active metabolism increasingbeige and brown fat cells is because norepinephrinereleased when we get into the cold binds to receptors on the surface of white fat cells and activatesdownstream pathways such as UCP1, so this is an uncoupling protein one, that acts on the mitochondrial metabolism of cells and increases the mitochondrial output of those cellsand the mitochondrial density of those cells. In other words, it takes a cell that has a kind of a weak engineor no engine for generating energy. Although every cell has some mitochondria, it takes cells that have very few mitochondriaand increases the engine size. It kind of stokes the furnace of those particular cellsand actually can change gene expression in those cells. So that's what's really interesting. Deliberate cold exposure causes increases in norepinephrine. which bind to receptors on the surfaces of white fat cells, which triggers the release of things like UCP1. It also causes the release of things like P-part gamma, and co-factor PGC1. I'm going to refer you to a review if you want to learn more about these. For those of you that don't want to learn more, all you need to know is that the downstream of all thatare increases in mitochondria and metabolism and actual genetic changes in the white fat cellsthat convert them into beige and brown fat cells. This is especially important for adultsbecause babies and young children actually don't havethe ability to shiver or they have a less robust capacity to shiver. Very small babies really can't shiverso they have a lot of brown fat in order to keep them warm. Young children eventually develop the ability to shiverand maintain these brown fat stores, mainly around the clavicles, the heart, the upper spine, and in the upper back. And it's no coincidence that kids can often run around with a minimal of clothing and be comfortable in environments that adults would be cold in. As life goes on, we tend to lose beige and brown fat, but this mechanism that I'm referring topoints to the plasticity of white fat, meaning the ability for white fat to actually convert its identity into this metabolically thermogeneticallyenhancing form of beige and brown fat. So deliberate cold exposure is a terrific wayto increase your core metabolism and oftentimes critics will say, well, the increase in metabolism isn't that significantalthough I do want to point out again, the 93% and 350% increases in metabolismfrom that previous study. But critics then will say, well, that doesn't really translate to that big of a caloric burnduring the deliberate cold exposure. But to that, you should say, ah, but that's only limiting your opticsto just a portion of the effects of deliberate cold exposure because deliberate cold exposure can also convert white fat to beige fat and brown fatand lead to these more lasting increases in metabolism. So for any of you interested in increasing your metabolismand or being comfortable in cold environments and or being comfortable in terms ofbeing able to combat stress mentally, deliberate cold exposure, I do believe is a powerful tool. And there is simply no reason why you couldn't and shouldn't use the same protocols that I described earlierfor building resilience to increase metabolism. Provided you're hitting that 11 minute per week threshold, you ought to be stimulating both mechanism increases in resilience and increases in core metabolism. As I mentioned earlier, most of the detailed studies on the conversion of white fat to beige fat and brown fat through the use of coldhave been done in animal models, but the human data are starting to emerge. And if you'd like to do the deep dive into these mechanisms, things like UCP1, P-part gamma, et cetera, there's a beautiful review that was published recentlyin the journal cell, which is one of the three apex journals, nature, science, cell. And the title of that paper is adipose tissue plasticityin health and disease. I love this review. It has beautiful diagrams detailing all of the pathwaysfrom cold to norepinephrine through UCP1 downstream of things like cyclic AMP. If none of those names mean anything to you, don't worry about it. You certainly don't need to know these mechanisms to benefit from deliberate cold exposure protocols. If those names do mean something to you, or you are interested in exploring the downstream effectsof deliberate cold exposure and something else that's really nice that's covered in this paper is how deliberate cold exposure interactswith fasted states and fed states. I think you'll also find this review very interesting. I don't want to go too deeply into fasted states and fed states right now, suffice to say that when we are fasted, meaning when we have an eaten for some period of time, our baseline levels of norepinephrineand epinephrine are already elevated. And so cold exposure at those timesought to have an even greater effect on metabolism and resilience and so on. So for you fasters or your intermittent fasters out there, if you really want to get fancy, you can do your deliberate cold exposure when you are fasted. I certainly wouldn't recommend doing itwith a very full stomach in any case. And as I mentioned before on this podcast, intermittent fasting is, but one way, and certainly there are other ways to limit total caloric intake for sake of maintainingor losing weight if that's your goal. I know many people are using and benefit from intermittent fasting, however, and so it certainly can be combined with deliberate cold exposures in order to get even greater increasesin norepinephrine and epinephrine. So for those of you that are primarily interested in using deliberate cold exposure",12213.0,2466.0,"This study looked at deliberate cold exposure in young, healthy men and found that by going into cold water immersion up to the neck for 11 minutes total per week, these men experienced increases in brown fat thermogenesis and core body temperature, which translated to increases in core body metabolism. Deliberate cold exposure can convert white fat cells into more metabolically and thermogenetically active beige and brown fat cells, leading to more lasting increases in metabolism. This is a powerful tool for increasing metabolism, being comfortable in cold environments, and combating stress mentally. The mechanisms behind this conversion are well-documented in animal models and are starting to emerge in human data.



                          , you can also do a combined protocolwhereby you ingest caffeine 60 to 120 minutes before the deliberate cold exposure. This is based on a study that I've talked about before entitled caffeine increases striatal dopamine D-2, D-3 receptor availability in the human brain. And as the title suggests, this study was done on humans                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , looking at the density and or efficacy of these dopamine receptorsin an area of the brain called the striatum                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , which is involved in planning in action and also suppressing planning in action. It's involved very closely with whether or not we can engage in behavior and withhold behavior, the so-called go and no go ways in the brain. Dopamine plays a critical role in that and many other things as well as you now know. So why would you want to ingest caffeine 60 to 120 minutes before deliberate cold exposure?Well, as I talked about earlier, dopamine can increase quite substantiallyin response to deliberate cold exposure, but dopamine on its own doesn't do anything, it has to bind to receptorsand this paper shows quite definitively that ingesting caffeine in this case, it was 300 milligram dose of caffeine, which is about the dose of caffeine in two or three cups of coffee, it depends on the strength of the coffee, of course, but it's not an outrageous amount of caffeine, that increases the density and or efficacyof these receptors, which you would allow that dopamine to have its greatest effect. And for those of you that want to get really, really fancy, I suppose you could do this fasted so you get the further increase in norepinephrine, then you get the dopamine increase from the cold exposure, the binding of the dopamine. Although I do want to point out that at some point, you start layering together enough protocols that you would to be spending your entire day trying to get this dopamine pulse and I would hope that you would have other activitiesthat you would engage in, but if you're getting up in the morning and you're fasted because you haven't eaten all nightand you have a cup of coffee, and then 60 minutes later, you take your cold shower or two hours later, you do your cold immersion or your cold shower, you would be layering together these different mechanisms of dopamine receptors, epinephrine and so forth in a way that at least to me, doesn't seem incompatible with having some other lifelike going to school and having relationships, et cetera. And this increase in dopamine, particularly in the striatum is not a trivial one. I do want to point out as the authors do that preclinical studies have shown that increases in striatal dopamineinduced by things like modafinil, which is used to treat ADHD and treat narcolepsy, is necessary for their wake promoting actions. What this really says is that just having elevated levelsof dopamine from a drug or from an ice bath, or what have you is not sufficient to get the effects of dopamine, you really need the receptors to be available and you need those receptors to be available in the appropriate densityand you need those receptors to be available in the appropriate density in the striatum in particular. So I think there are a number of reasons whyif it's compatible with the other aspects of your health, cause of course always you have to consider this on a background of cardiovascular healthand blood pressure, et cetera, that ingesting a cup or two of coffee an hour before your ice bath may be fasted as wellcould be quite beneficial for increasing dopamine over quite extended periods of time. A couple of key points that you'll want to pay attention to",3641.0,754.0,":

- To increase dopamine levels, you can combine caffeine ingestion with deliberate cold exposure.
- Caffeine increases the density and efficacy of dopamine receptors, allowing dopamine to have its greatest effect.
- Preclinical studies have shown that increases in striatal dopamine are necessary for wake-promoting actions.
- It's important to consider the compatibility of caffeine ingestion with other aspects of your health, such as cardiovascular health and blood pressure.","What is the relationship between caffeine ingestion and dopamine levels, and what should be considered before combining caffeine with other health aspects?

"Tools: Increasing Metabolism w/Cold – The Søberg Principle, Shivering:","in thinking about deliberate cold exposure and metabolism. In the Søberg study, they also explored the use of sauna and how to use sauna, meaning deliberate heat in conjunction with cold. We are going to do an entire episode about the use of heatfor health and performance. So that is not the focus now, however, it does raise an important point that we do need to address at this moment, which is if you are using saunaor if you are taking warm showers or if you are simply using deliberate cold exposureof any kind, should you get into the heat afterward or before or not at all?And this is where we can point to the so-called Søberg principle, at least I call it the Søberg principle, the Søberg principle named after first author of this study, I referred to earlier, Dr. Susanna Søberg. In science, it is appropriate to take a key piece of data and call it a principleif in fact it translates to something larger, which I believe it does. It is generally not appropriate for peopleto name a principle after themselves although there are a few scientists that have done that. So I have named it the Søberg principle, but I did that to give it appropriate credit to Dr. Susanna Søberg, who discovered that and pointed out quite appropriately, that to achieve the greatest increases in metabolismthrough deliberate cold exposure, you want to force yourself to reheat on your ownafter the deliberate cold exposure, meaning you wouldn't want to go from the cold shower to a hot shower or from the cold shower to a sauna. Rather if you were going to start with a hot shower or you're going to start with a sauna that you would end with the cold, and then you would reheat naturally. Now I personally take a cold shower a few times a weekor do cold immersion and because I'm not specifically focused on increasing metabolism, although I probably should be, that's not what I'm using it for now, I will take a hot shower afterwards and in doing so, I'm short circuitingsome of the further metabolic increases that I would achieve were I to just end with the cold. So the Søberg principle is if you want to increase your metabolism, end with cold, and we can take this a step further and say that if you want to use deliberate cold exposureto increase metabolism, that you should make sure that you get to the point where you shiver. And the reason in for this is that there are a series of studies, but in particular, one study published in the journal Nature, excellent journal in the year 2018, showing that deliberate cold exposure that evokes shiveringfrom the muscles causes the release of a molecule called succinate from the musclesand that succinate plays a key role in activating brown fat thermogenesis, which you now have heard about and understand as critical to the increases in metabolism caused by deliberate cold exposure. So what this means is if you want to increase your metabolism, end on cold, that's a Søberg principle and as best you can, try and get to the point where you are shivering either when you are in the cold exposureor immediately afterwards. Now one efficient way to do this is to, for instance, you could get into the cold shower for a minute or two minutes or three minutes, uncomfortably cold, but safe to stay in. Remember that's our general rule of thumb. Then turn off the water and stand there, make sure that you're not holding yourself close to your body, you're not hugging yourself to try and keep yourself warm, but rather your limbs are extended at your sides. And then if that fails to induce shiverthan to turn on the cold water again, and then turn it off again, so alternating perhaps a minute to three minutesof cold exposure followed by a minute to three minutes of drying out in air and going back into the cold exposure, et cetera. I can tell you this from experience, this is a pretty brutal protocol. If you have never tried getting into an ice bathor cold water immersion or shower for one minute and then getting out and trying to stand there with your arms extended in cool or cold air for one minute, and then getting back into the cold shower or water immersion, you are in for an experience becauseeven for those of you that are pretty shiver resistant, you'll find that it is much, much harder to get out of that cold water and stand there arms extendedand drying off by evaporation, which further draws heat from the body than it is to wrap yourself in a towel, get in a warm shower or a sauna. So there's certainly no requirement to end on cold. There's certainly no requirement to induce shiver, but if your primary goalis to induce increases in metabolism, both in the short term and in the long term, following the cold exposure, well then you'll want to end on cold and you'll want to find a way to shiverprovided that the level of cold that you're exposing yourself to is still safe for you overall.",4869.0,1033.0,"The Søberg principle, named after Dr. Susanna Søberg, suggests that to achieve the greatest increases in metabolism through deliberate cold exposure, you should force yourself to reheat on your own after the exposure. This means that if you want to use deliberate cold exposure to increase metabolism, you should end with cold and try to get to the point where you are shivering either when you are in the cold exposure or immediately afterwards. This is because shivering causes the release of a molecule called succinate from the muscles, which plays a key role in activating brown fat thermogenesis. One efficient way to induce shivering is to alternate between cold exposure and drying out in air. However, there is no requirement to end on cold or induce shivering, and the level of cold exposure should still be safe for you overall.",What is the Søberg principle and how does it suggest increasing metabolism through deliberate cold exposure?

Norepinephrine & Fat Cells:,"So up until now, I've been talking about deliberate cold exposure as a potent stimulus for the release of norepinephrinein the brain and body and indeed it is, but the way I've been describing it has been in the contextof circulating plasma levels of norepinephrine, meaning circulating within the blood. What I haven't mentioned, but is absolutely true is that the fat cells themselvesactually receive input from neurons. So there are neurons that release norepinephrinein response to cold, directly into the fat. So I want to give you this picture of how the architectureof all this works, because I think it can help you navigate and indeed build better deliberate cold exposure protocols. Your adrenal glands release norepinephrine and epinephrine. Your brain has sites within it like the locus coeruleusthat release norepinephrine and epinephrine, but there are also neurons within your skin that sense coldand other neurons that can directly release norepinephrine into the fat stores and cause those white fat cellsto convert to beige and brown fat. And I think this particular aspect of our physiology is often overlooked in studies. And when people say, oh, well the increases in metabolism aren't that great, the circulating levels of norepinephrine, those are very large, but they're very transient and so on, that fails to understand that neuronsthat actually sense cold are in a position to communicate via other neurons directly to the fat cellsand release norepinephrine into those fat cells, which as I pointed out earlier, set off a huge set of immediateand long term cascades of even gene expression changes. So the picture that I'd like you to have in your mindis that when you get into the cold, yes, of course you experience that as a experience ofI don't want to do this, I'm going to overcome this, I'm going to climb over these mental walls that represent adrenaline release in my brain and body, but also that your fat cells are receiving signals, norepinephrine signals that are changing those fat cellsand the way that they metabolize energy. Now I'd like to shift our attention to the use of deliberate cold exposure",2144.0,455.0,"as a potential therapy for various health conditions. Studies have shown that regular exposure to cold can improve insulin sensitivity, increase metabolism, and even reduce inflammation. However, it's important to note that there are potential hazards associated with cold exposure, such as hypothermia and frostbite. It's crucial to start slowly and gradually increase exposure time and intensity, and to always listen to your body's signals. Additionally, individuals with certain health conditions, such as Raynaud's disease or cardiovascular disease, should consult with a healthcare professional before attempting deliberate cold exposure. Overall, deliberate cold exposure can be a powerful tool for improving health, but it should be approached with caution and proper guidance.","What are the potential benefits and risks associated with deliberate cold exposure, and how should individuals approach it according to Andrew Huberman?",Cold Exposure,Andrew Huberman,90,1684717116
"Cold, Physical Performance, Inflammation:","for sake of physical performance. And there are a lot of opinions out there about the use of deliberate cold, whether or not it should be done for instance, before or after exercise, whether or not if done immediately after strength trainingor hypertrophy training, meaning training designed to grow muscles or make them stronger, whether or not it can inhibit that processand so on and so forth. I think today in looking over the literature and trying to bring forward the simplestand most straightforward, and yet scientifically grounded protocols, we can set up some general guidelines that will allow most, if not, all of you to still extract the benefits of deliberate cold exposure on physical performancewithout getting too neurotic about the exact timing, but for sake of discussionand because it's a prominent theme in many online communities, let's just start with the big one out there, meaning the question of whether or not doing an ice bath or doing deliberate cold exposure or taking a cold showerafter strength slash hypertrophy training, meaning training designed to increase strengthand or I should say the size of muscles will somehow short circuit or diminish that process, whether or not it will reduce or eliminate those strength gains and hypertrophy gains. And the short answer that I was able to arrive aton the basis of a review article that I'll talk about in a moment and some other studies as well, is that if your main goal is hypertrophy and strength, it is probably best to avoid cold water immersion and ice bath immersion in the four hoursimmediately following that strength and or hypertrophy training. Again, if your main goal is to achieve hypertrophyor strength or some combination of those, probably best to avoid cold water immersion up to the neckor ice bath immersion up to the neck immediately after strength and hypertrophy trainingand extending out to about four hours after that training. If you're really neurotic about this, then perhaps you'd want to move the cold water exposure to a different day entirely, but it all depends on how neurotically attached you are to getting every last bit of strength and hypertrophy. And if that's your goal, terrific, well then probably moving the cold exposure four hoursor more away from that training is going to be necessary for you. Now you'll notice I did not talk about cold showersand the reason I did not talk about cold showers is that there simply are not very many studiesof deliberate cold exposure through cold showers for the reasons I talked about at the beginning of the episode. It's hard for me to imagine that taking a brief cold shower after a strength or hypertrophy training sessionwould completely reverse or short circuit the effects of that strength and hypertrophy training. But again, if you're neurotically attachedto getting every last bit of strength and hypertrophy out of your training sessions, then by all means, err on the side of caution and wait four hours or more to do your cold shower just as you would wait four hoursor more to do your cold water immersion. Now there are nice data pointing to the fact that doing cold water immersion after a hard run, so endurance training, or even sprint and interval training or after a weight workout where your main focusis on performance of those movements or after a skill training workout where your main focus on performance of those movements, that there's no reason to think that that cold water immersion or ice bath or cold showerwould inhibit the progress or the stimulus that would lead to progressthat occurred during that training session. In other words, I don't see any reason based on the literature to avoid deliberate cold exposureimmediately after training, again unless your goal is hypertrophy and strength. And in fact, there's a very nice review recently published on deliberate cold exposureand how it can impact physical performance, whether or not it's done before or after, different types of training and so forth. The paper is entitled impact of cold water immersioncompared with passive recovery, following a single about of strenuous exercise on athletic performance in physically active participants, a systematic review with meta-analysis and meta regression. So this is a meta-analysis of 52 studiesthat looked at a tremendous number of variables and contexts, as you would expect in a meta-analysisof 52 studies. I'm going to read you the conclusions of the study and I will provide a link. We certainly don't have the time to go throughall the details of the study. I will highlight a few specific outcomes that I found particularly interesting, but here I am paraphrasing their conclusions, that cold water immersion, I want to emphasize immersion, not cold showers, but cold water immersion they say was an effective recovery tool after high intensity exercise. They observed positive outcomes, meaning improvements in certain variables, for muscular power, muscular soreness, meaning reduced muscular soreness, increased muscular power, perceived recovery after 24 hours of exercise. However, there were certain forms of exercisethat were not benefited by cold water immersion, such as eccentric exercise, exercise focusing only on the lowering component or the so-called eccentric component of resistance exercise. They saw some very entry dose response relationships for things like endurance training, meaning the longerthe cold exposure post-endurance training, the more improvement in endurance performance, reductions in circulating creatine kinasesand things that relate to muscle damage under certain conditions. At some point in the future, by the way, we'll do an entire episode on creatine and creatine kinase, which are important not just for muscular function, but also for brain function. But the basic takeaway was that cold water immersionperformed after high intensity exercise was beneficial from a number of different standpointsand indicated that shorter duration, cold exposure and lower temperaturescan improve the efficacy of cold water exposure if used after high intensity exercise. There I'm directly pulling from their conclusions. So what this says is that it's not just those longer duration, 30, 45 minute and 60 minute protocolsof cold water immersion that we discussed earlier, but also shorter duration of one minute, three minute, five minute exposures to lower temperatures. Temperatures that would make you psychologicallywant to get out as soon as you possibly can, but again that you can safely stay indone after training really have been shown to improve outcomes in terms of reducing sorenessand improving training efficacy, meaning your ability to get back into training more quicklyand thereby deliver more training stimuli to a given muscle or in your endurance training protocol. Translate to English, what this means is that taking a cold shower or getting into an ice bath or some other form of cold water immersionwithin the immediate minutes or even the immediate hours following your training has been shown to be beneficial. I'm sure a number of you have questions for instance, how long should you be in that cold exposure?Is it the same as the 11 minute threshold described earlier? To be honest with you, there are not enough studies to really pointto the critical threshold for eliminating or reducing delayed onset muscle sorenessor for getting maximal results from power and endurance training, but this study does make a couple of key pointsand here I will just paraphrase. For instance, that cold water immersion is more likely to positively influencemuscular power performance, to reduce muscle soreness, to reduce serum creatine kinase, and to improve perceived recovery after high intensity exercise, as compared with passive recovery. This can be translated to cold water exposure after training is beneficial and probably betterthan passive recovery from a number of standpoints. In addition, they say that dose response relationshipsmeaning the amount and the degree of cold that people were exposed to and how often they did thatin particular in lower temperature cold immersion. So these would be the sorts of cold immersion protocolsthat are one minute or two minutes, three minutes, maybe five minutes, but that one couldn't stay in there longerbecause it feels stressful and one wants to get out. Maybe more effective after high intensity exercisefor removal of serum creatine kinase as well that these shorter durationcold water immersion approaches may be more effective after high intensity endurance performance as well. So all of this can be translated to say that unless your main goal is hypertrophy and strength, that cold exposure, ideally cold immersion and cold water ice bath, but if you don't have access to that, then cold showers is likely going to be beneficial if done immediately after or in the minutesor hours after your training, especially high intensity training. One particularly nice thing about this meta-analysisis that it included some studies that involve the use of cooling packs. So again, vests that can essentially ice packsand indeed even cryotherapy chambers and so on. There's a nice table in the study if you want to get really detailed and goand look specifically at those studies, I invite you to do that. We'll put a link to this study in the captionfor this episode, but all in all, what this study shows is that deliberate cold exposurecan be very useful for recovery likely through reductions in inflammation, in muscle and connective tissue. And while this study did not look specifically at the mechanisms of reduced inflammationcaused by deliberate cold exposure, those mechanisms are somewhat known. There are a number of studies that have pointed to the factthat deliberate cold and cold generally can reduce inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, interleukin six. It can increase anti-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 10 and so on. Without getting into all those details, I think it's sufficient to say that if you are somebody who experiencesa lot of delayed onset muscle soreness, taking a cold shower after your training or getting into a cold immersion after your training, even if it's a few hours later ought to help. And if you are doing particularly intense training, then you probably want to ratchet up the number of cold exposure sessions that you're doingeven if those have to be done on separate days from your training, because a lot of the inflammatory effects of training, endurance and strength training are actually occurring some hours away from the training stimulus. So it's not just that inflammation goes upradically during training, which it often can, but that it can occur even in the days and even weeks afterwards, depending how intense and how long duration that training is. So deliberate cold exposure is very powerfulas an anti-inflammatory tool. Now I'd like to emphasize the topic that we touched on at the beginning of the episode,",10998.0,2096.0,"which is the importance of not getting too neurotic about the timing of cold exposure. While it is best to avoid cold water immersion immediately after strength and hypertrophy training if your main goal is to achieve hypertrophy or strength, there is no reason to avoid it after endurance training, sprint and interval training, or skill training. In fact, taking a cold shower or getting into an ice bath or some other form of cold water immersion within the immediate minutes or even the immediate hours following your training has been shown to be beneficial for reducing muscle soreness, improving training efficacy, and improving recovery after high intensity exercise. The critical threshold for eliminating or reducing delayed onset muscle soreness or for getting maximal results from power and endurance training is not yet known, but shorter duration cold water immersion approaches may be more effective after high intensity endurance performance. Deliberate cold exposure is very powerful as an anti-inflammatory tool and can reduce inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and increase anti-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 10. Therefore, taking a cold shower after your training or getting into a cold immersion after your training, even if it's a few hours later, ought to help with delayed onset muscle soreness. However, it is important not to get too neurotic about the timing of cold exposure and to focus on the overall benefits it can provide for recovery and performance.","What are the benefits of cold water immersion after training, and why is it important not to be too neurotic about the timing of the exposure, according to Andrew Huberman?",Cold Exposure,Andrew Huberman,50,1684717240
Hyperthermia & Glabrous Skin Cooling:,"which are those glabrous skin surfaces, the hands, the upper face, and the bottoms of the feet through which heatis especially good at leaving the body. And another way of putting that is that one can coolthe body much more efficiently through the glabrous skin surfaces. Now, if you want to understand all of the sciencebehind this and all of the various applications, I invite you to please listen to the episodethat I did with Dr. Craig Heller, again, in the biology department at Stanford. For sake of this episode, I'm just going to detail a couple of findings from his laboratory. The first one, dealing with exercise induced hyperthermia, because I think this is very interesting and it can even save lives if you understand the way this works. There's a particular paper that focuses on this, and we will put a link to this as well. The title of this paper is novel applicationof chemical cold packs for treatment of exercise induced hyperthermia, a randomized control trial. This is a pretty brutal study, brutal for the subjects that is. This study involved was having subjects walk on a treadmill at a pretty significant incline and anywherefrom nine to 17% wearing a substantial amount of clothing that was not well ventilatedand the room was kept to 40 degrees Celsius, which is 104 degrees Fahrenheit. This is definitely not something to do at home. This study was designed to induce hyperthermia, which as I mentioned earlier, can be quite dangerous. And they compared two types of cooling. In the first form of cooling that they call traditional cooling, they had ice packs on their neck, in their armpits and in their groin. And in the other group, there was the so-called glabrous skin cooling. So the palms, the soles of the feet, which were actually so they were cooling inside the bootsor inside of gloves and on the upper portion of the face. And the basic takeaway of this study is that by cooling the glabrous skin, the subjects were able to sustain this walking on these inclined treadmills for much longerthan were the people who received traditional cooling. And also the return to baseline temperaturewas much faster in the glabrous skin cooling group. So how this translates to the real worldis that if ever you are hyperthermic or someone else's hyperthermic, one way to cool them down quickly is to coolthese palmer glabrous, soles of the feet glabrous and upper portion of the face glabrous portions of the bodyusing cool rags, using ice packs or using any number of different cold objects or temperatures. One key thing, if you're going to use glabrous skin cooling, is that whatever you use to cool those surfacescannot be so cold that it causes vasoconstriction. Because as I mentioned earlier, the arterio-venous anastomoses these portals of arteries directly to veins that exist only in these glabrous skin surfaces, the way that they're able to cool the body and essentially pass cool into the body although that's not really what they're doing, they're actually extracting heat from the body to be technical, they're extracting heat from the body, the only way they can do that is if those veins don't collapse and veins will collapseif they are made very, very cold. So if you want to use glabrous skin cooling to offset hyperthermiaor for the other forms of performance, which we'll talk about in a moment, you need to use a cool object or surfacethat is not so cold that it causes vasoconstriction. And this can be a little bit tough to dial in, meaning it can be tough to identify such an object. And for that reason, Dr. Heller and some of his colleagues have developeda commercial product called the CoolMitt. You can actually go to their website, coolmitt. com. I don't have any financial or other relationship to them. I know they've been developing this technology for some period of time. It involves a glove that you put your hand into, it circulates water of a given temperature and it does so, and does so at a tempera or that is sure to notcause vasoconstriction of the palm. And you may be asking, how can you just put your hand into one gloveand have this work? Well, that's how powerful these glabrous skin surfaces are. Even just by cooling one palm, the core body temperature drops radically. Now that's their commercial technology. I know that some people out there have started to experiment with a home version of this, which would be taking a package for instanceof frozen blueberries or some other cold drink or cold metal object, and actually bringing it into the gymor out on a run. There are even people who are now developing cooled psych bicycle handles for long rides. This might seem a little kooky or crazy to you, but as you'll soon hear in the study I'm about to describe, the increases in enduranceand in the volume of strength training that people can conduct if they appropriately cooltheir body through these glabrous skin portals is actually quite significant. So again, as it relates to hyperthermia, if someone is overheating by all means, try and get them out of that heat, get them to stop exercising, you can die from hyperthermia, try and cool the bottoms of the feet, the palms of their handsand the upper portion of their face. That does not mean it would be a bad ideato put cold water on the top of their head. That probably would also help and perhaps on their neck. What is probably not going to be a good idea is to dothe more standard thing of draping someone in cold towels on the surface of their body because as I mentioned, the beginning of the episode, that thermostat in the hypothalamus, the medial preoptic area will typically react to thatby increasing core body temperature further. The effects of glabrous skin cooling on physical performance",5745.0,1231.0,"Glabrous skin surfaces, such as the palms, soles of the feet, and upper face, are efficient at cooling the body. Cooling these areas can help offset hyperthermia and improve physical performance. In a study, subjects who received glabrous skin cooling were able to sustain exercise on inclined treadmills for longer and returned to baseline temperature faster than those who received traditional cooling. However, it's important to use a cool object or surface that is not so cold that it causes vasoconstriction, which can collapse veins. A commercial product called the CoolMitt has been developed to cool the palms without causing vasoconstriction. Some people have also experimented with home versions of cooling objects, such as frozen blueberries or cooled bicycle handles.","What is the Søberg Principle and how does it relate to the cooling of glabrous skin surfaces, according to Andrew Huberman?",Cold Exposure,Andrew Huberman,10,1684717395
Tool: Palmar Cooling & Endurance:,"are truly remarkable provided the glabrous skin cooling is done correctly. And I want to point out that the main degree of effectis on volume or the ability to do more work. And I want to point this out because I think that many people, certainly in the exercise science community, but even in the general public, when they hear about some of these effects that are measured in the laboratory, they sort of look at those effects a bit of scans and they think, well, that's not possible. Effects for instance, that have been documented showing doubling or tripling of the number of dips that one can do in a relatively short amount of timeor doubling of the number of pullups one can do or 14% increases in strength or even comparable degreesin increase in weight training output to people who are on performance enhancing drugs, et cetera, et cetera. Part of the confusion is that the effects of proper palmer cooling, because it almost always is done by palmer cooling and less often in these experimentsby cooling of the bottoms of the feet and the upper portion of the face, but those effects tend to be the ability to do more workover time and just to illustrate some of the major effects that the Heller lab is seen and they are document entered in this manuscriptthat I'll share with you in a moment. The typical protocol is to have people come inand do some endurance training so running on a treadmill and to have a condition whereone group is actually doing palmer cooling while they are on a bike or on a treadmill and inevitably the outcome is that they can do more work. They can pedal further at a given speed, or they can run longer at a given speed than peoplewho are not doing palmer cooling or who are receiving cooling by way of cold compress to the back of the neck or ice packto the armpits, et cetera. So the effects of palmer cooling are very clear and very robust. And in the context of endurance exercise almost always allow people to do more work, to go longer with less perceived effort and to quit later so to speak. In terms of strength training, they've looked at the capacity to perform sets of dips. So one of the more famous examples of this that Dr. Heller shares in the episode that we did earlier, and that you can find at hubermanlab. com involves someone coming in and doing sets of dips, maybe 40 dips. This person actually could do 40 dips on their first set, then resting for a period of two to three minutes and then doing 35and then resting for a period of two or three minutes, and then doing progressively fewer and fewer and fewer to the point where over a period of time, they add up the total number of dips that they can do and then they have them come back after a period of recovery, so not immediately after, but take a couple of days, come back and do effectively the same protocol, but during their rest periods, they're doing two minutes of palmer cooling, which essentially allows heat to move out of the body, lowering core body temperature in other words. And what they find is that they see enormous increasesin the total number of dips that people can do, but that doesn't mean that the person goes from being able to do 40 dips, to being able to do 50 dips or 60 dips on that first set, what it means is they are able to do 40 on the first set, then 40 on the second, then 38 on the third and so on and so forthso that the total duration of the workout is extended and yet they're doing much more work, even though it takes more time. So that's an important point and I think a point that perhaps wasn't as clearor as clearly made by me in the previous episodes that discuss this topic. For those of you that are interestedin exploring palmer cooling, first of all, I recommend taking a brief glance or even a deep diveinto this study, which is entitled work volume and strength training responses to resistive exerciseimprove with periodic heat extraction from the palm. In this study, they describe big increases in anaerobic, meaning strength training output, things like improvement in dips, improvement in bench press, improvement in pull-ups, et cetera, in human subjects. And it's a really nice study and pointsto some of the protocols that you might be able to adapt in your own setup. For instance, over six weeks of pull up training, palm cooling in between sets improved volume by 144%, and this was in experienced subjects. So that's interesting because a lot of studies of strength training and improvements in hypertrophyand strength are done in inexperienced untrained athletes, which changes the picture somewhatcompared to experienced athletes. They found that strength, meaning the one repetition maximum, increased 22% over 10 weeks in bench press training. And they point to the particularly strong effectsof using palmer cooling when people reach plateaus in endurance and strength training. And there, I think it's an important point. I think that if you're going to explore palmer cooling, it's probably not the sort of thing that you're going to do in every run or in every about of cyclingor in every strength training session, but that it might be used to vastly increase your volumeor vastly increase your endurance in a given session or a set of sessions in order to push through plateaus. A particularly interesting point in light of that is Dr. Heller has observed again and againthat palmer cooling reduces delayed onset muscle soreness, or it can eliminate it entirely. And that's very interest because it also points to the factthat reducing core body temperature may somehow be involved in short circuiting the normal mechanisms of delayed onset muscle soreness. And you might say, well, how would temperature be involved in delayed onset muscle soreness? Well, I want to refer you back to the meta-analysisthat we talked about earlier, where the short duration, very cold temperature exposure after training did indeedreduce delayed onset muscle soreness in part through reduction, excuse me, in creatine kinase. So it's not inconceivable that temperatureand delayed onset muscle soreness are related. And that raises perhaps the most important point, which is the way that palmer cooling can improve performanceby way of reducing core body temperature is known and that is because when one engages in exerciseor muscular output of any kind, strength or endurance exercise, the range of temperatures under which a muscle can performis actually very narrow. There's an enzyme called pyruvate kinase, which is critical to muscle contractionsand pyruvate kinase can only function in a very narrow range of temperatures. If that temperature gets too hot, meaning if the muscle heats up locally, whether or not by running or cycling or swimming or weightlifting, the ability for that muscle to continue to contract is reduced and eventually is short circuited completely. And I think this is a much underexplored or at least a much under discussed aspectof so-called muscular failure or the failure of one to continue to endure in running. So for instance, when you run as compared to a bench press or something, you don't stop running because you can't actually contract the muscles further, but somehow signals about the heating up of muscular tissue are conveyed to the brain. There's a crosstalk there, it's probably bidirectional and people stop, they quit. This is the quitting reflex. In strength training, one can no longer perform a repetition or set of repetitions in partbecause of heating up of the muscle locally. There are other mechanisms as well, of course, and I realize that, but what's very clear from the palmer cooling work is that by simply holding onto a cool object, remember not an object so cold that it constricts the vessels of the palms or constricts the vessels on the bottoms of the feet, but by holding onto a relatively cool object in one or both hands in between sets for two minutes or so, you can very efficiently reduce your core body temperature and in doing so, reduce the temperature of the musclesthat are doing the work, increase the capacity for pyruvate kinase to continue to allow your muscles to contractand thereby allow you to do more volume of endurance and strength training. So a simple protocol that Dr. Heller passed to meis find a relatively cool object. So you could, for instance, fill two bottles with cold water, maybe put a few ice cubes in there. This is not exact because we're not talking about the commercial CoolMitt product here, we're talking about an at home version or use a pack of frozen blueberries or broccolisort of pack of those as what he described. And then in between sets to put your handsand ideally you'd put the bottoms of your feet, but that's not always feasible in most gyms where they won't let you take off your shoes and so forth, but to put the palms of your hands on that cool surface for a minute or two minutes between setsand then returning to your sets of work. Now, if you are heating up through other mechanismslike you're wearing a stocking cap and you're in a very warm environment, this might not have as potent effect as if you were to do this coolingin a more moderate environment, wearing lighter clothing, et cetera. So by all means warm up to do your exercise, lubricate your joints, and get into a place where you're not going to injure yourself, doing whatever form of exercise you do. But then if you'd like to explore palmer cooling, I know a number of people who've written to me saying they heard about palmer cooling on the episode with Dr. Heller. They've tried this and they see quite excellent results. It does take some discipline. It's one thing to just kind of hang out in the gym and play on your phone in between sets. It's another to do deliberate cooling with your palmsor the bottom of your feet or the upper portion of your face. You might get some weird looks, but of course you'll be the one doing significantly more volume, not experiencing delayed onset muscle soreness and achieving better endurance and strength gains were you to do this properly. Now as a final topic related to the use of deliberate cold exposure for improving health",10154.0,2111.0,"Palmer cooling can significantly improve endurance and strength training by allowing individuals to do more work over time. The effects of proper palmer cooling are measured in the laboratory and have shown to double or triple the number of dips or pull-ups one can do in a short amount of time. Palmer cooling reduces delayed onset muscle soreness and can eliminate it entirely. The ability for muscles to contract is reduced when the muscle heats up locally, and palmer cooling can efficiently reduce core body temperature, allowing individuals to do more volume of endurance and strength training. To explore palmer cooling, find a relatively cool object and put the palms of your hands on it for a minute or two between sets. It takes discipline, but it can significantly improve endurance and strength gains.","According to Andrew Huberman, how can palmer cooling improve endurance and strength training, and what are the benefits of proper palmer cooling?",Cold Exposure,Andrew Huberman,70,1684717499
Tool: Optimal Timing for Daily Cold Exposure:,"Now I promise you the last topic was the last topic, but there's one other really important point that I think everyone should be aware ofif you're going to use deliberate cold exposure. And that brings us back to the very first thingthat we discussed today, along the lines of deliberate cold exposure, which is that your baseline temperatureis going to be lowest about two hours before you wake up, it's going to increase in the morningand as you wake up and increase throughout the day and afternoon, and then start to drop in the evening and come down at nightas you head to sleep. I also want you to remember that if you are to coolthe external portion of your body, in particular your torso, the net effect of that is going to be an increasein body temperature. So for many people, not all, but for many people, if you are going to do deliberate cold exposure, you are going to increase your core body temperatureand that makes sense if you think about how deliberate cold exposure can increase metabolism by increasing thermogenesis. What that all means is that if you are doing your deliberate cold exposure early in the day, you are going to get yet a further increase in core body temperature that would be associated with wakefulness, your ability to be alert that morning or throughout the day and so on. It also means that if you do your deliberate cold exposurevery late in the evening, or at night, so 6:00 PM, 7:00 PM, 9:00 PM and so on, you are going to increase your core body temperature and if you recall, a decrease in core body temperatureof one to three degrees is not just beneficial, but is necessary in order to get into deep sleepand remain in deep sleep. So the takeaway from this is deliberate cold exposuredone properly will increase your core body temperature and make you feel more alert. So if you're doing it early in the day, that's probably terrific given that most of us want to be alert during the day. However, if you do it too late in the day, evening or night, it can disrupt sleep by way of disrupting your core body temperature. Now, the caveat to that is I myselftend to do deliberate cold exposure early in the day. Maybe not first thing in the morning, but mid morning, maybe as late as three or four in the afternoon in some cases. In the longer days of summer, I might do it even later, five or 6:00 PM and have no trouble sleeping. I have done deliberate cold exposure very late at night, 10:00 PM, 11:00 PM and so on as part of a 30 day challenge of doing deliberate cold exposure every day for 30 daysand I got sloppy with my timing and then in order to not miss a day, I would do it at 11 o'clock at night. And I must say I found that I could still fall asleep very easily, even doing deliberate cold exposure very late at night. However, on those particular days, I was particularly busy and so I was particularly exhausted when I arrivedat the deliberate cold exposure and I had no trouble falling asleep after doing deliberate cold exposure, and then taking a nice warm shower and then going to sleep. But I could imagine that because of the increases in core body temperature caused by deliberate cold exposure, that were one to do that too late in the day, evening or night that it could indeed disrupt your sleep. So my recommendation would be for most people only do deliberate cold exposure if you are prepared to be fairly alert for the next oneto four or maybe had been six hours following that deliberate cold exposure. So for today's episode,",3506.0,747.0,"the main takeaway is that deliberate cold exposure can increase your core body temperature, which can be beneficial for alertness if done early in the day. However, if done too late in the day, it can disrupt sleep by disrupting your core body temperature. It's important to be aware of your timing and how it affects your body's response to cold exposure. It's recommended to only do deliberate cold exposure if you're prepared to be alert for the next few hours following the exposure.","What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of deliberate cold exposure, according to Andrew Huberman?",Cold Exposure,Andrew Huberman,20,1684717606
Tool Moderate Exercise before cognetive:,"that I think you will find particularly interesting and useful. The title of this study is brief aerobic exerciseimmediately enhances visual attentional control and perceptual speed, testing the mediated role of feelings of energy. Now, the reason I like this study is first of all, it's a fairly large size sample group. They looked at 101 students. These were college-aged students and they had two groups. One group did 15 minutes of jogging at moderate intensity. So they did measure percent heart rates, et cetera, but this would be analogous to zone two cardio, which I've discussed on this podcast before. Zone two cardio is cardiovascular exercisethat places you at a level where you can hold a conversation with a little bit of strain, meaning that you can get the words out, but every once in a while you have to catch your breath whereas if you were to push any harder by any mechanismgoing faster or on a steeper incline, et cetera, that you would have a hard time carrying out a conversation. So zone two cardio is a common form of describingthat level of intensity that they call moderate intensity. So one group did 15 minute of jogging at moderate intensity, which I'm translating to roughly zone two cardio. The other group did 15 minutes of relaxation concentrationthat is somewhat akin to mindfulness meditation. And then they were analyzed for perceptual speed, visual attentional control, something called working memory, which is your ability to keep certain batches of information online. Just imagine someone telling you their phone number, and you have to remember that sequence of numbers in your head for some period of time, that's working memory. And it depends very heavily on the so-called prefrontal cortical networks, which are involved in planning and action. And they also looked at people's feelings of energy and they measured that subjectively, how energetic people felt. Now the major takeaways from this study that I'd like to emphasize are that the 15 minutes of jogging groupexperienced elevated levels of energy for some period of time after they ceased the exercisewhereas the group that did mindfulness meditation actually reported feeling more calmand having less overall energy. Now that's very subjective and indeed they used subjective measures to analyze energy, but what gets interesting is when they looked at performance on these various cognitive tasks and the two tasksthat they use were called the trail making tests, they have different versions of this, version A, version B, I don't want to go into too much detail, but version A essentially involves having a page of numbersthat are distributed somewhat randomly. So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight and so on, but distributed randomly across the pageand people have to use visual search to circle those numbers in sequence. So this involves visual attention, it involves some motor skills, involves a number of things that certainly require energy and focus. The second test was the trail making test part B, as I mentioned earlier, and this involved also circling numbers in sequence, but interspersed between those numbers were letters. So rather than just having to circle off numbers in sequence, they actually had to connect one, then the letter A, then two, then the letter B, et cetera and remember these are randomly distributed across the page. The major takeaway from the study is that the group that did the 15 minutes of moderate exercise prior to these two testsshowed significant decreases in the amount of time required to complete these tests accurately. That is interesting and indeed surprising at least to me, because there have been many studies looking at the effectsof mindfulness meditation on the ability to focus. The key variable in the study turned out to be energy. This subjectively measured feeling I should say of having more energy and thereby the ability to focus, especially in these high cognitive demand tasks. Now the takeaway from this study for all of us I think is pretty straightforward. If you are going to sit down to do some work that requires focus and working memoryand cognitive attention and especially if it's some visual spatial control, meaning you have to search for things on a page, you have to organize things on a page, so some writing, arithmetic, basically cognitive work of any kind, 15 minutes of moderate exercise done prior to that work about could be very beneficial for you. This does not mean that mindfulness meditation would not be a benefit to you. I wouldn't want you to conclude that, but if you had to choose between doing 15 minutes of mindfulness meditation and doing 15 minutes of moderate exerciseprior to a cognitive work about, I would say the 15 minutes of moderate exercise would bemore valuable at least based on the data in this paper. In many previous podcasts, I have talked about the powerful effects of doing thingslike mindfulness meditation, and other forms of NSDR, non-sleep deep rest. So these could be 20 minute naps or just lying there quietly with your eyes closed or yoga nidra or NSDR scripts are available on YouTubeand various other places free of cost of any kind. You just go to YouTube, put in NSDR, non-sleep deep rest. Those protocols have been shown to be very beneficialfor enhancing neuroplasticity, the changes in the brain and body that encodeor shift the neural circuits that allow for memory to change, that allow for learning to occur after a learning about. What I'm referring to today in this particular study is the use of moderate exercisein order to increase one's focus and attention in order to trigger that neuroplasticity. So the simple sequence here is get energetic and alert, do that prior to the learning about, engage in the cognitive work or learning about, and then mindfulness meditation, NSDR and so forth should follow. And if you would like to access this paper and like to look more at the details in the paper, we'll be sure to put a link in the show notes. The first author is Legrand. And again, the title of this paper is brief aerobic exerciseimmediately enhances visual potential control and perceptual speed, testing the mediating role of feeling of energy. And I also just want to emphasize immediately. I think most people out there are interested in tools and protocols that work the first timeand that work every time and indeed, I think this protocol fits that bill. I'm pleased to announce that I'm hosting two live events this May.",6501.0,1305.0,"The study titled ""Brief Aerobic Exercise Immediately Enhances Visual Attentional Control and Perceptual Speed, Testing the Mediated Role of Feelings of Energy"" looked at 101 college-aged students who were split into two groups. One group did 15 minutes of moderate intensity jogging, while the other group did 15 minutes of relaxation concentration similar to mindfulness meditation. The study found that the group that did moderate exercise showed significant decreases in the amount of time required to complete cognitive tasks that required focus, attention, and visual spatial control. The key variable in the study was energy, and the group that did exercise reported feeling more energetic and focused. The takeaway is that 15 minutes of moderate exercise prior to cognitive work could be very beneficial for enhancing focus and attention. Mindfulness meditation and NSDR are still valuable, but exercise prior to cognitive work is more valuable based on the data in this paper. The study emphasizes the importance of getting energetic and alert before engaging in cognitive work to trigger neuroplasticity.

Circadian Rhythm & Body Temperature:,"Let's talk about the use of cold for health and performance. I confess I love this topic because it takes me back to my undergraduate yearswhen I worked in a laboratory studying cold physiology, its effects on the brain and its effects the body. And over the years, I've always kept track of the literature in this area and indeed there have been some tremendous discoveries, both in animal models, so in rodents like mice and rats, but also in humans and today we're going to talk about both categoriesof studies and I'll be careful to point out when discoveries were made in animal models and when they were made in humans. A key point when thinking about the use of cold as a tool, and the key point is that you have a baseline levelof temperature that is varying, changing across the 24 hour cycle. So any use of deliberate cold exposure is going to be super imposed on that rhythm, that circadian rhythm, meaning that 24 hour rhythm. The basic contour of your circadian rhythm in temperatureis that approximately two hours before the time you wake up is your so-called temperature minimum. So your temperature minimum is a time within the 24 hour cycle when your body temperature is at its lowest. So if you normally wake up around 6:00 AM, your temperature minimum is probably about 4:00 AM. If you normally wake up at about 7:00 AM, your temperature minimum is probably about 5:00 AM. It's not exactly two hours before your wake up time, it's approximately two hours before your wake up time. Now, as you go from your temperature minimum to the time in which you're going to awake, your temperature is rising slightly. And then at the point where you wake up, your temperature starts to go up more sharply and will continue to go up into the earlyand sometimes even into the late afternoon. And then sometime in the late afternoon and evening, your temperature will start to decline. And indeed, as you approach sleep, your body temperature will drop by anywhere from one to three degrees. And in fact that decrease in core body temperature is important if not essential for getting intoand staying in deep sleep. So temperature rises with waking, that's easy to remember. It tends to continue to rise throughout the day and in the late afternoon and evening, your temperature WILL start to go down and the dropin temperature actually helps you access sleep. That background or what we call baseline circadian rhythmin core body temperature is important to remember because it helps us frame both the effectsof deliberate cold exposure and helps us frame when you might want to use deliberate cold exposurein order to access specific states. It also points to times within the 24 hour cyclewhen you might want to avoid using deliberate cold exposure, if your primary goal is to get to sleep.",1202.0,244.0,"The use of cold for health and performance has been studied in both animal models and humans. It's important to note that any deliberate cold exposure is superimposed on the circadian rhythm, which has a temperature minimum approximately two hours before waking up. As you wake up, your temperature rises slightly and continues to rise throughout the day, but in the late afternoon and evening, it starts to decline, which is important for accessing deep sleep. Deliberate cold exposure can be used to access specific states, but it's important to avoid it if your primary goal is to get to sleep.","What is the relationship between deliberate cold exposure and the circadian rhythm, and how can it affect sleep?

"Tool: Quickly Decrease Core Body Temperature, Glabrous Skin:","What I'll tell you, and we'll get into this in more depth later, is that if you really want to cool down quickly and efficiently, you should leverage particular portals, meaning particular sites on your body where heat can leave your body more readily and where cooling can have a dramatic and fast impact on your core body temperature, can even save your life if you're going hyperthermic. We're going to talk more about the specific protocols to reduce core body temperature for sake of performance and avoiding hyperthermia later in the episode. Hyperthermia of course is a very, very dangerous situation because while your body can drop in core temperature somewhat and still be safe, you can't really increase your body temperature that much before your brain starts to cook and other organs start to cook and by cook, I mean the cells actually start to die. So you have to be very, very careful with the use of heat. Heat stroke is no joke. People die from heat stroke all the time. You really want to avoid that. One way to avoid that is to cool the appropriate surfaces of your body and the appropriate surfaces in this case are the upper cheeks or I would say the upper half of the face, the palms of your hands and the bottoms of your feet. I've talked about this on the podcast beforeand in the guest episode with Dr. Craig Heller, my colleague in the biology department at Stanford, but just very briefly, these surfaces, the upper half of the face, the palms of the hands and the bottoms of the feet are what we call glabrous skin surfaces, G-L-A-B-R-O-U-S, glabrous. And those surfaces are unique in that just below them, the vasculature is different than elsewhere in the body. Normally the passage of blood goes from arteries to capillaries to veins, but just beneath the glabrous skin on the bottomsof the feet, the hands in the upper half of the face, you have what are called arterio-venous anastomoses. These are portals of blood that go directly from arteries to veins and in doing so, allow the body to dump heat more readily, more quickly. So as it turns out that if you are to cool the palms of the hands, the bottoms of the feet and the upper half of the face, you can more efficiently reduce core body temperature for sake of offsetting hyperthermiaand for improving athletic performance and maybe even cognitive performance. So we will return to the specific protocolsfor doing that later in the episode, I'll give you a lot of details about how to do that, how to do that without the use ofany fancy or expensive technology. There are some technologies that are now commercially available, for instance, the so-called CoolMitt that will allow you to do that with maximum efficiency, but I'll also give you some at home methods to do thiseither in the gym or on runs or for sake of cognitive work. So the two key themes againare understand that baseline circadian rhythm in temperature, and understand that the best way to coolthe body is going to be by making sure that something cold contactsthe bottoms of your feet, the palms of your hands and the upper half of the face. Ideally all three if your goal is to lower core body temperature quickly, and again, just cooling off the back of your neck or the top of your head or your torso with a towelis going to be the least efficient way to lower core body temperature and might even increasebody temperature under certain conditions. With those two points in mind, we can start to think about directed deliberate",6680.0,1425.0,"The approach to cooling the body is to utilise the glabrous parts of the body. Glabrous parts of the body are places where the bloods runs very close to the skin and thereby quite quikly can be cooled. One specific area of interests are the hands, so by cooling the hands, such as by grabbing a cold object can induce coldness in the body and thereby slowly and surely provide a safe method for cooling the body without sending mixed signals to the heads thermostat",What is the best practice to cool a very hot person?,Cold Exposure,Andrew Huberman and Susanna Søberg,90,1685321494
Mental Effects of Cold Exposure:,"And I want to separate those out for you. There are cold protocols that have been testedin peer reviewed studies that are designed to improve mental performance. They are designed to improve things like resilienceor your grittiness, or your ability to move through challenge or to regulate your mind and your internal stateunder conditions of stress and we can define stress very specifically as timeswhen adrenaline also called epinephrine and or norepinephrine also called noradrenaline, are elevated in your body. Forgive me for the noradrenaline, norepinephrine, adrenaline, epinephrine nomenclature, I didn't make that up. It turns out that every once in a while, scientists disagree, imagine that, and you'll get multiple scientistsnaming the same molecule different things. So epinephrine and adrenaline are the same thing. I will use them interchangeably. Norepinephrine and noradrenaline are the same thing. I will use those terms interchangeably. Noradrenaline and adrenaline are often co-released in the brain and body. So they work as kind of a pair to increaseour level of agitation, our level of focus and our desire and our ability to move. They are often co-released from different sites in the brain and body with dopamine, a molecule that is commonly misunderstood as the molecule of pleasure, but is actually the molecule of motivation, reward and pursuit. So dopamine, norepinephrine and noradrenalinetend to be released together under certain conditions and today you'll learn how deliberate cold exposurecan be used to cause increases in the release of several, if not, all of these in waysthat can improve your levels of attention and your mood. But the key point is that your mental state is shiftedwhen you are exposed to certain forms of cold, and many people use deliberate cold exposurespecifically to shift their body state as a way to train their mental state so that they can better copewith stress in real life and by real life, I mean when life presents stressful events, and I will give you specific protocols as to how you can do that, in other words, how you can become more resilientthrough the use of deliberate cold exposure. Now, because of the ways in which deliberate cold exposurecan increase this category of chemicals called the catecholamines, that includes dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine, it can also be used to elevate mood for long periods of time. And I'm going to discuss a specific protocolthat has been shown to increase these chemicals anywhere from 2. 5X to 250%, to as high as 500%, five times over baseline. Now you might be asking whether or not it is a good thingto raise chemicals like norepinephrine and dopamine to such a great degree, whether or not that's healthy for us, whether or not they can harm us. But it turns out that these elevations in norepinephrine and dopamine are very long lasting in waysthat people report feeling vast improvements in mood and vast improvementsin levels of cognitive attention and energy. So by my read of the literature, these seem to be healthy increases in our baseline levels of these chemicals in ways that can really support usso I'll give you a protocol for that. Now, those are some of the mental effects of deliberate cold exposure,",3249.0,689.0,"but there are also physical benefits. Cold exposure has been shown to increase metabolism, improve immune function, and even aid in weight loss. It can also improve circulation and reduce inflammation in the body. However, it is important to note that cold exposure can be dangerous if not done properly. It is important to start slowly and gradually increase exposure time, and to never stay in cold water or air for too long. It is also important to avoid cold exposure if you have certain medical conditions, such as heart problems or Raynaud's disease. Overall, deliberate cold exposure can be a powerful tool for improving mental and physical health, but it must be approached with caution and proper guidance.","What are the potential physical benefits of deliberate cold exposure, according to Andrew Huberman and Susanna Søberg, and what precautions should be taken when practicing it?",Cold Exposure,Andrew Huberman and Susanna Søberg,90,1684717986
Physical Effects of Cold Exposure:,"but deliberate cold exposure has also been studied in animal models and in humans in the context of increasing metabolism, even in converting certain fat cells that we call white fat cells, which are the ones where energy is stored, they're the ones that we typically think of as kind of blubbery fat, to beige or brown fat, which is thermogenic fat, meaning that it can increase core body temperature and serves kind of the furnaceby which we increase our core metabolism. So with a very broad stroke, I can say that white fat is generally the kind of fat that people want less of and beige fat and brown fatis generally the kind of fat that if you're going to have fat cells and you certainly need fat cells that you want more of. They are thermogenic, they help you stay lean. They actually serve as a reservoir for heating your body up if you're ever confronted with a cold challenge. So we're going to talk about how to use cold for metabolism as well. And of course, people are using deliberate cold exposureto reduce inflammation post exercise, to reduce inflammation generally. And people are also using cold to enhance performancein the context of strength training, in the context of endurance training and we'll talk about those data as well,",1253.0,252.0,"Deliberate cold exposure has been studied in animals and humans to increase metabolism by converting white fat cells to beige or brown fat, which is thermogenic and helps increase core body temperature.

How Cold Should the Temperature Be?:,"but where I'd like to start is with mental performance and I'd like to detail what happenswhen we deliberately expose ourselves to cold. It's key to point out the word deliberate. If I don't say otherwise, then throughout this episode, if I say cold exposure, I mean deliberate cold exposure. And the reason I point that out is that as my colleague, David Spiegel, and the department of psychiatry at Stanford says, it's not just about the state that we are in, it's about the state that we are in and whether or not we had anything to with placing ourselves into that stateand whether or not we did that on purpose or not. And what he really means by that statement is thatthere are important effects of what we call mindset. Mindset was a topic discussed in the guest episodewith Ali Crumb some weeks ago. If you haven't seen that episode, I highly recommend it. And the science of my mindset tells us that if we are doingsomething deliberately and we believe that it's going to be good for us, it actually can lead to a different setof physiological effects than if something is happening to us against our will or without our control. Now, this is different than placebo effects. Placebo effects are distinct from mindset effects. If you want to learn more about that distinction, please see the episode with Ali Crumb. But again, when I talk about cold exposure in this episode, I'm talking about deliberate cold exposure, meaning that you are placing yourself into acold environment on purpose in order to extract a particular set of benefits. When we talk about deliberate cold exposure, almost always, that means getting uncomfortable. And one of the most common questions I get when discussing the use of cold for sake of mental or physical performance, metabolism, et cetera, is how cold should it be? How cold should the water be? How cold should the environment be?And I just will tell you now and I'm going to say this again and again throughout the episode, cause it will continue to be true throughout the episodeand long after the episode is over, how cold depends on your cold tolerance, your core metabolism, and a number of other features that there is simply no wayI could know or have access to. So I would like you to use this rule of thumb. If you are using deliberate cold exposure, the environment that you place yourself intoshould place your mind into a state of whoa, I would really like to get out of this environment, but I can stay in safely. Now that might seem a little bit arbitrary, but let's say you were to get into a warm showerand it would feel really, really nice and you were to start turning down the warm and turning up the cold. There would be some threshold at whichit would feel uncomfortable to you. And if you were to continue to make a little bit colder than that, you would really want to get out of the shower, but you are confident that you could stay in without risking your health, without risking a heart attack. Now that's very different than jumping into a very, very cold lake orI've seen these images of people that will cut holes into frozen over lakes and they'll get into that cold water. If you are trained to do that and you have the right conditions, et cetera, that can be done reasonably safely, but that's certainly not what I would start with. And for many people, that would be too cold and indeed some people can go into cold shockand can die as a consequence of getting to that extremely cold water very quickly. Now that's not to scare you away from deliberate cold exposure. It's just to say that there's no simple prescriptive of how cold to make environment in order to extract maximum benefitfor mental or physical performance. So the simple rule of thumb is going to beplace yourself into an environment that is uncomfortably cold, but that you can stay in safely. And you'll have to experiment a bit and that number, meaning that temperature, will vary from day to day. It will vary across the 24 hour cyclebecause of that endogenous, meaning that internal rhythm, in temperature that I talked about earlier. Low early in the day, rises into the afternoon, drops at night. You can actually do this experiment if you like. Try getting into a cold shower at 11 o'clock at night if you want versus try doing itin the middle of the afternoon. It's quite a different experience and by quite a different experience, I mean it requires quite a different degree of resilience and leaning into the practice. Your willpower will have to be higher I suspect late in the day as it compared to early in the day, but that will vary of course between individuals as well. So the most common question I get about deliberate cold exposureis how cold should the water be? And we've answered that with uncomfortably cold to the pointwhere you want to get out, but you can safely stay in. The second most common question I get about deliberate cold exposure is whether or not",4934.0,1030.0,,"What is the key point that Andrew Huberman and Susanna Søberg make about deliberate cold exposure and mindset, and how does it differ from placebo effects?",Cold Exposure,Andrew Huberman and Susanna Søberg,0,0
Cold Showers vs. Cold Water Immersion:,"cold showers are as good, better or worse than cold water immersion up to the neck, for instance. I also get a lot of questions about whether or not cryo chambers are better than all the others, et cetera, et cetera. I'm going to make all of that very simple for you by saying cold water immersion up to the neck with your feet and hands submerged alsois going to be the most effective. Second best would be cold shower. Third best would be to go outside with a minimum amount of clothing, but of course, clothing that is culturally appropriate and that would allow you to experience cold to the pointwhere you would almost want to shiver or start shivering. Now there are a number of different, important constraints that are going to dictatewhether or not you use one form of cold exposure or the other. For instance, some people don't have access to cold water immersion. They don't have access to ice baths or cold water tanks, cold ocean or cold lakes, et cetera. In that case, showers would be the next best solution. I do want to emphasize that there have been very few, if any, studies of cold showers, and you can imagine why this would be the case. In a laboratory, you want to control for as many variables as possible. So placing people into a cold water immersion or an ice bathup to the neck and insisting they keep their hands and feet under is very easy to control. It means that everyone can do essentially the same thing whereas with cold showers, people are different sized bodies. Some people are going to put their head under. Some people are going to lean forward. Measuring the amount of cold water exposure on the bodyis very hard to do and so there aren't a lot of studies of cold showers, but of course, a lot of people don't have access to cold water immersion so they have to use cold showers. And if you don't have access to both, of course, then going outside on a cold day can be of a benefit. But I will point out that the heat transferfrom your body into water is much higher, four times greater, if not even greater, depending on the temperature of the water, in water as opposed to in air. So it's going to be much more efficientto do cold water immersion than anything else, cold showers after that and put yourself into a cold environment would be the third best thing. I'm not going to get into cryo chambers because they carry quite a high degree of cost. And again, there aren't many studies of them. So if you have access to cryo chambers, I'm sure that the cryo chamber facility has told you about all these incredible benefitsand I don't doubt that some of those benefits truly exist, but most people just don't have the resources or the access to thoseso we're going to leave cryo chambers out of today's discussion. And of course I realize there's a fourth category of cold exposure out there. People are wearing ice vests. Believe it or not, those exist, ice underwear. Yes, those exist. You can look for them on Amazon if you like. They are putting cold packs in their armpitsor in their groin or elsewhere in order to stimulate some of the effects of coldon mental and physical performance. I'm not going to address those in too much detail today. They can be efficient in certain ways, but as you'll learn about later in the episode, cooling the palms, the upper faceand the bottoms of the feet is going to be far more efficient and unfortunately I think most of the people that are usingice packs to increase their core metabolism are not aware of the glabrous skin coolingand how it can be a very, very potent stimulus so we'll return to that later. Unless I say otherwise, I'm mainly going to be focusing on cold water immersion and cold showers. So let's talk about protocols for enhancing mental health",3756.0,806.0,"Cold water immersion up to the neck with hands and feet submerged is the most effective form of cold exposure, followed by cold showers and going outside with minimal clothing. Cold showers have not been extensively studied, but are a good alternative for those without access to cold water immersion. Cryo chambers are expensive and have limited studies, so they are not discussed. Ice vests and packs can be efficient, but cooling the palms, upper face, and bottoms of the feet is more effective. The focus will mainly be on cold water immersion and cold showers for enhancing mental health.","What are the most effective forms of cold exposure for enhancing mental health, according to Andrew Huberman and Susanna Søberg?",Cold Exposure,Andrew Huberman and Susanna Søberg,80,1684718099
Protocols for Cold Exposure:,"and performance using deliberate cold exposure. What happens when we get into cold is that we experiencean increase in norepinephrine, in noradrenaline release and in adrenaline release. The fact that cold exposure, deliberate or no, increases norepinephrine and epinephrinein our brain and body means that it is a very reliable stimulus for increasing norepinephrine and epinephrine. That's sort of an obvious statement, but that obvious statement can be leveragedto systematically build up what we call resilience. Now, when we experience a stressor in life, whether or not it's something bad happens in our relationship or something bad happens in the worldand we feel stress, that stress is the consequence of increases in norepinephrine and epinephrine in our brain and body. Very similar, if not identical, to the kinds of increases that come from deliberate cold exposure. So deliberate cold exposure is an opportunity to deliberately stress our body and yet, because it's deliberate and because we can take certain steps, which I'll describe in a moment, we can learn to maintain mental clarity, we can learn to maintain calm while our body is in a state of stress. And that can be immensely useful when encountering stressors in other parts of life. And that's what we call resilience or grit, our ability or mental toughness, our ability to lean into challenge or to tolerate challengewhile keeping our heads straight, so to speak. So one simple protocol for increasing resilienceis to pick a temperature that's uncomfortable of shower or cold immersion, and then to get in for a certain duration of timeand then to get out. Now, it's important to understand that people will experience different levels of norepinephrine and adrenaline releasewhen getting into cold water. Some people, because they dread the cold so much, will actually experience norepinephrine and epinephrine increases even before they get into the cold wateror under the cold shower. Now you may have experienced this. I've certainly experienced this. I'm dreading it, I don't want to do itand I have to force myself to do it. And indeed epinephrine and norepinephrine and its surgescan be thought of as sort of walls that we have to confront and go over. And I'd like you to conceptualize them that way, because it allows us to build protocols that can be very objective and can allow usto monitor our progress in terms of building resilience. So one option is to simply say, okay, I'm going to force myself to get into the cold shower for one minute. How cold, again, uncomfortably cold, but you can stay in safely or I'm going to get into the ice bath for one minute. Ice baths are very cold inevitably. And what is also inevitable is that when you get into the cold, you will experience a surgein epinephrine and norepinephrine. That's non-negotiable because it's mediated by cold receptors on the surface of your bodyand your skin and the way that they trigger the release of norepinephrine and epinephrine, not just from the adrenals, from the adrenal glands above your kidneys, but also from regions of your brain, like the locus coeruleus, which cause increases in the tension and alertness, and from other locations in your body where epinephrine and norepinephrine are released. In other words, cold is a non-negotiable stimulusfor increasing epinephrine and norepinephrine. Even if you are the toughest person in the worldand you love the cold, that increase in epinephrine and norepinephrine is going to happen. So the way to think about norepinephrine and epinephrine in this context of building mental resilienceis that you have two options. You can either try to extend the duration of timethat you are in the deliberate cold exposure. So going from one minute to 75 seconds to two minutesand so on over a period of days or one way to approach this and the way that I particularly favoris to take the context of the day and the moment into account, meaning we have different levels of grit and resilienceon different days and depending on the landscape of our life at the time, even the time of day that we're doing these protocolsand start to be able to sense the release of epinephrine, and norepinephrine in our brain and body and see those as walls that we want to climb over in order to build resilience and to start countingthe number of walls that we traverse and the distance between those walls as we do deliberate cold exposure. Let me give you an example of the timed protocol because that one is very straightforward, although I do not think it is as powerful for building mental resilience. The time protocol would be Monday, I do one minute of deliberate cold exposure at a given temperature. Wednesday, I extend that by 50% and Friday, I do deliberate cold exposure for twice as long as I did it on Monday. And if I were to continue that every week, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, I would continue to either increase the duration or I would lower the temperature and reduce the duration, this kind of thing, very much like sets and reps in the gym. Now that option is very objective. You could even log it in a bookand as you develop the ability to stay in cold temperatures, even progressively colder and colder temperatures for longer and longer periods of time, you will become more resilient. What do I mean by that? Well, my operational definition of resilience is that you are able to resist escape from the stressor, the cold, by virtue of your willpower, which is really your prefrontal cortexcausing top down control on your reflexes and your limbic system and your hypothalamus, which are basically telling you to get out of that cold water, get out of that cold environment and in doing so, you are basically getting better at controlling your behavior when your brain and body are flooded with norepinephrine and epinephrine. That's a very reductionist way to explain resilience or grit or mental toughness, but it's a reductionist way of explaining itthat is very closely tied to the biology end of the psychology. And it is a fact that norepinephrine and epinephrinerelease in the brain and body are the generic universal code for stressor. There is no unique chemical signature for different forms of stressors, that is the only one, although of course there areother chemicals involved as well. So you could go for time and you could try and reduce the temperature and increase the timeover a period of days or weeks. Now that's an attractive way to approach things, but the problem is that you don't have an infinite amountof room with which to lower temperature, because eventually you will get into temperatures that are either so cold that they are dangerousor you have to stay in cold temperatures for such long periods that it becomes impracticalbecause presumably you also have to take care of other aspects of your life, you can't just sit all day in the ice bath. Now for that reason, I favor a protocol in which you build mental resilience and mental toughness throughtwo different types of protocols. The first one involves counting walls. Now, what do I mean by walls? I mean the sensation of, no, I don't want to do this and the idea or the sensation in your brain and body that you actually want to leavethat environment and go warm up. Now again, for some people, that will be even before getting into the ice bathor cold shower. So if you are feeling very resistant to getting into the ice bath or cold shower and you manage to do that, that's going over what I would call one wall. Then for some period of time, you might actually feel comfortable in the ice bath, cold water or cold shower. And you feel like you could stay there for some period of time, that you could stay there for a minute or two minutes, but inevitably, the next wall will arrive. And I would encourage you to pay attention to when that next wall arrives and actually having an awareness, that so-called interceptive awareness as we call it, of when that next surge adrenaline epinephrine comesor whether or not it reaches a certain threshold in your brain and body that you feel you want to get out and you're able to stay in for even just 10 seconds longer, that means you've traversed yet another wall. And if you continue to stay in that cold environment, you'll find that the next wall will come and the next wall will come. Now eventually of course, you will get very, very numbdepending on how cold it is and you could also place yourself into danger. So you have to maintain cognitive control, counting these walls, traversing these walls, but getting out at some point, of course. So my favorite protocol for building mental toughness AKA grit, AKA resilience, is to take into account that some days, just getting into the ice bath or cold shower represents a wall, some days it doesn't. Some days you get in and you feel you could go 10 minutes, other days you get in and you feel like you could only go a minute and setting a designated numberof walls before you start the protocol is going to be very beneficial here. So you say, as long as I can do it safely, I'm going to do three walls today. The first wall is getting in. The second wall will arrive when it arrivesand the third wall will arrive when it arrives and I'll get over that wall and then I'll get out. The next day, you might do five walls. The next day, you might do three walls again, but you might lower the temperature. This gives you tremendous flexibilityand indeed it gives you much more latitude to be able to use the same temperatures in different ways, or to reduce the temperature only a little bit and still get a lot of stimulus, meaning a lot of results out of a given protocol. Whereas people who are just going for temperature and time eventually become cold adapted. They get very, very good at doing three minutesor six minutes or even 10 minutes at a given temperature and so then they feel like they have to lower the temperature even more and even moreand eventually they just bought them out. There's nowhere else to go. There's no way to get improvements out of the protocol. At least not in terms of mental resilience. Of course, there's still the positive effectson inflammation and metabolism, et cetera, that we'll talk about in a little bit. But the key thing here is to design protocolsthat are going to work for you over time and for you very, very hardy, very, very tough guys and gals out therethat can get right into an ice bath or a very, very cold immersion and you can just grind it out for six or 10 minutes, or you can even do that by remaining peaceful, well more points to you, but guess what?That's the equivalent of already having loaded up the barbell with 600 pounds and done your 10 reps. There's not a whole lot more variable space with which to get benefits from that stimulus. And in the weight room, people understand that you can adjust, for instance, the speed of the movement, or you can start combining that movementwith pre-exhaustion, et cetera. With cold exposure, you don't have as much variable space to play with. So if your goal is to build resilience, either go for time as a function of temperature, or what I suggest is to start recognizing these wallsas an experience of resistance in you and going over those walls, set a certain number of wallsthat you're going to go over on a given day and do that at a given temperature, and then to mix it up. And ideally you might even throw in one more wall at the end, if you're really feeling bold and bravebecause that's going to build out further resilience. But if you want cold exposure to work for you for sake of building up resilienceand mental toughness over time, you're going to want to vary this parameter space in some sort of way. And you don't have to be super systematic about it. That's the beauty of this kind of approachbecause you're relying on the fact that those walls really represent times in which you are forcing your top down control, your prefrontal cortex to clamp down on your reflex and you're learning behavioral control in the contextof your body having elevated levels of these catecholamines, norepinephrine and epinephrine. And that translates to real lifein a much more realistic way I believe because in real life, you're not really engaging in stressorsfor a given amount of time that you know how long it's going to last and you know the context, no. Most stressors arrive in the form of surprises we don't like, text messages that deliver bad news, information about the outside world or real world and online interactions that send our systeminto a state of increased norepinephrine and epinephrine. And if you start to think of those as walls that you can tolerate and climb overwhile staying and calm and clear of mind, then you can really imagine how the ice bathand other forms of cold exposure are really serving to train you up for real life stressors.",12897.0,2773.0,"Deliberate cold exposure can increase norepinephrine and epinephrine in the brain and body, which can be leveraged to build resilience and mental toughness. One protocol for increasing resilience is to pick an uncomfortable temperature for a cold shower or immersion and gradually increase the duration over time. However, this approach has limitations as there is only so much room to lower the temperature or increase the duration. A more effective approach is to recognize the walls of resistance that arise during cold exposure and set a designated number of walls to overcome each day. This approach allows for more flexibility and variability in the protocol. The goal is to build behavioral control in the context of elevated levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine, which can translate to real-life stressors. It is important to maintain cognitive control and not place oneself in danger during cold exposure.","What is the recommended approach for increasing resilience through deliberate cold exposure, according to Andrew Huberman and Susanna Søberg, and what are the potential limitations of other approaches?",Cold Exposure,Andrew Huberman and Susanna Søberg,50,1684718201
Optimal Mindset(s) During Cold Exposure:,"The next question that I always get is what should my mental state be while I'm exposing myself to this uncomfortable, yet safe condition of cold? Well, you have two options and there are probably other options as well. One is to try and calm yourself to remain as mentally still as possible. The other is to lean into that challenge and so to grind it out and here, I have to say that this is a lot like teaching someone to drive on a gravel road. For any of you that have driven on a gravel road, you know that there is no optimal speed for all gravel roads. It depends on the density of the gravel, et cetera, and the vehicle, et cetera. So for instance, on some gravel roads, when you start to drive and the dust starts to kick up, your best option is to drive fast and put that dust cloud behind you. On other gravel roads, if you try and do that, the dust actually kicks up around the vehicle and it makes it hard to see and sometimes you have to slow down. The same thing is true for getting throughdeliberate cold exposure. Sometimes it's easier to calm yourself. One way to do that is through double inhalesthrough the nose and extended exhales through the mouth, or simply by trying to control your breathingand reduce the pace of your breath and increase the volume of your breathing. I have to say that everyone experiences a shortening of breath when they get into uncomfortably cold water, that is a universal physiological response. Everyone also experiences a 30 to 80% decreasein cognitive function, in particular, the frontal cortex. The metabolism of your frontal cortex goes down, the metabolism meaning the activity of brain areas associated with stress and panic goes way up. And so anchoring your mind in cognitive activities as you get into the cold can be very, very helpful for maintaining clarity of mind. In fact, one thing that I sometimes recommendis that people try and engage in some sort of cognitive exercise while in the cold, not as a form of distraction, but as a way to maintain clarity of thinking and to learn how to do that when the body is flooded with all these chemicals that make us stressed. So for instance, you could do math problems and not two plus two equals four, not three times three equals nine, but things that require a little bit more focus and attention working memory and so forth. You could also start to have thoughts that you deliberately impose a full sentence structure on. That's actually quite tough. You could try and recall specific bouts of information that are challenging. This is teaching your mind how to stay online, or rather I should say, this is you teaching your prefrontal cortex, how to stay engaged while you have high levels of stress in your body. Years ago, I had a friend who worksin the neuroscience world, research neuroscientist, who was obsessed with this very bizarre sportthat I don't necessarily recommend at all, which is the combination of boxing and chess. You may have seen this on YouTubewhere people will box around, legitimate boxing around, they're sparring all out often. And then at the end of the round, instead of resting in the corner, they actually sit down and play chess, and then they go back to boxing and back to chess. Again, not a sport that I recommend, but the reason he was obsessed with this is because he studies the impact of stress on cognitive performance. And what that particular very bizarre sport was doing was toggling back and forth between different states of mind. Now it's used both to increase cognitive clarity for the fighter when they box, because staying calm and clear thinking is very important to winning boxing matches. Believe it or not, it's not an all outrage. It's a very calculated game of mental chess and physical chess that's quite high stakes as you can imagine. It's also used in some circles as a way to teach people how to engage in cognitive performancewhen their body is simply filled to a stress. So in the boxing chess example, the replacement for the cold water is actually the boxing, it's the thing that's supposed to induce the stress cause getting hit is stressful and the risk of getting hit is stressful for most people. So again, if you think about deliberate cold exposure as a way of just systematically and reliablyinducing epinephrine and norepinephrine release and delivering stress, well then this idea of maintaining cognitive clarityand actually engaging in cognitive tasks while in the ice bath or cold shower can actually be very beneficial. Even though it might sound a little bit silly, you are really training up your ability to keep your brain working when the reflex is to shut down the parts of your brainthat are involved in deliberate planning and thinking. Now another important aspect of deliberate cold exposure",4796.0,976.0,"is the importance of gradually increasing the intensity and duration of exposure. It's important to start with shorter exposures and gradually increase the time and intensity to avoid potential hazards such as hypothermia or frostbite. It's also important to listen to your body and not push yourself too far beyond your limits. Overall, deliberate cold exposure can have many benefits for physical and mental health, but it's important to approach it safely and with caution.","What are the potential hazards of deliberate cold exposure, and how can they be avoided according to Andrew Huberman and Susanna Søberg?",Cold Exposure,Andrew Huberman and Susanna Søberg,90,1685289743
Tool: Using Movement During Cold Exposure:,"that I rarely if ever hear discussed, but is vitally important is whether or notyou move around or not. And here's the reason. When you get into cold water and you remain therefor some period of time, your body is generating heat and that heat generates what's called a thermal layerthat surrounds your entire body. So if you stay still, you are actually warmer than if you move around, you can try this the next time you're doing your deliberate cold exposure. If you're submerged up to the neck, sit there for about 10, 30 seconds and be very, very still of body. In fact, this is the way that most people start to do deliberate cold exposure. They give this very stoic look. They don't blink, they look very peaceful. Some of them even look tough or they make a very even A, emotional faceand so it looks like they're really tough, but they are so still that believe it or not, they're not providing the most potent stimulus. If they or you were to move around in that water, what would happen is you'd break up the thermal layerand that you actually experience that as much colder. So if you really want to push the resilience aspect, or for instance, if you want to use a given temperature that you're comfortable in, but that you want to increase the stimulusand you want to get some more benefit for mental resilience training, well then get into the cold water, move your body around continuously, but try and keep your mind still, or even do some sort of cognitive task. So as you're starting to realize, there are a bunch of different variables that you can play with while maintaining the same temperature of water and in doing so, really keep you in the zone of what should and absolutely has to be safe for youwithout having to just continually drop the temperature from say 60 degrees to 55 to 40 to 33 because as I mentioned before, eventually you're going to bottom out. So if you're one of those people that likes to look tough or really relaxed while you're in the ice bathor cold water immersion, just realize that you're actually cheating yourself out of part of the stimulus. Keep those limbs moving and of course, limbs under the water, feet and handsis going to be a more potent stimulus than hands and feet out for reasons that should be obvious based on what we talked aboutin terms of glabrous skin cooling. Keep those submerged, move your body, maybe move your knees up and down, pedal your feet and trust me, it's going to feel a lot colder than were you to remain stone still.",2505.0,537.0,"When doing deliberate cold exposure, it is important to note that remaining still in cold water generates a thermal layer that surrounds the body, making you warmer than if you move around. However, moving around continuously in cold water breaks up the thermal layer and provides a more potent stimulus for mental resilience training. It is possible to play with different variables while maintaining the same temperature of water to keep yourself safe without continually dropping the temperature. Keeping limbs submerged and moving them around is more effective than keeping them out of the water.","What are the benefits of moving around continuously in cold water during deliberate cold exposure, according to Andrew Huberman and Susanna Søberg?",Cold Exposure,Andrew Huberman and Susanna Søberg,70,1685289826
Optimal Frequency of Cold Exposure:,"Another very common question is how often to do deliberate cold exposure. It's tough to make a recommendation on thatbased on any peer reviewed study although there are a few in humans that point to a thresholdof 11 minutes total per week. So that's total throughout the week divided into two or four sessionsof two or three minutes or so. Now that 11 minute cutoff is not a strict threshold and is actually geared more towards increases in metabolism, we'll get into this a little bit later in the episode, but I think the 11 minute threshold, meaning 11 minutes total of deliberate cold exposure per week is a pretty good number to useif you need a number in order to keep you consistent. But as we talked about earlier, some of you are going to be in the ice bathor cold immersion or cold shower for one minute, others of you will be in there for 10 minutes, depending on how frequent and how high, if you will, those walls of adrenaline are coming. So for some of you, getting into a cold shower for three minutes totalfor the whole week will represent a tremendous achievement in terms of willpower and overcomingthe resistance to doing that, overcoming those walls. For others of you, three minutes is nothing. So what do I recommend, I recommend that you get at least 11 minutes total per week, but at the point where 11 minutes total per weekis very easy for you, where is no longer representing a significant mental challenge, meaning you're not experiencing many of these walls, you're excited to get into the cold shower immersion, you're going through it easily, you're cruising basically. Then I would say either lower the temperature safely, of course, extend the duration safely, of course, or increase the frequency so that you're doing this perhaps every day or maybe five days a weekor three days a week. I personally get tremendous benefit from doing deliberate cold exposure three times a weekand using the walls method that I described earlier as my gauge for how long to stay in and typically that means that I'm staying in for anywherefrom two minutes to six minutes per session and that averages out to about11 to 15 minutes total per week. So again, I do not think that you need to be super strictabout these guidelines. It's most important when embracing a protocol A, that you do it safely, but secondarily that you do it consistently. So find what you can do consistently and then vary the parametersthat will allow you to continue to do deliberate cold exposure consistently, regardless of whether or not you have access to a showeror cold immersion, et cetera. So we've been talking about mental effects and the use of deliberate cold exposure",2673.0,549.0,"The recommended threshold for deliberate cold exposure is 11 minutes total per week, divided into two or four sessions of two or three minutes. This threshold is geared towards increasing metabolism. However, it's important to note that this is not a strict threshold and can vary depending on individual tolerance levels. It's recommended to start with 11 minutes per week and increase the duration, frequency, or lower the temperature as it becomes easier. Consistency is key, so find what works for you and stick to it. The mental benefits of deliberate cold exposure have been discussed. Safety is also important when practicing deliberate cold exposure.","What is the recommended threshold for deliberate cold exposure according to Andrew Huberman and Susanna Søberg, and how can it be adjusted based on individual tolerance levels?",Cold Exposure,Andrew Huberman and Susanna Søberg,90,1685289961
"Cold Exposure for Dopamine, Mood & Focus:","for sake of building resilience, which I do believe can be tremendously powerful. Look, it's no coincidence that the screeningand the training for Navy Seals involves a lot of exposure to cold water. One could argue that it is deliberate because they elect to go to buds, but when they get into the cold water at budsis dictated by the instructors and the reason they use cold water exposure as the stressoris that it does offer considerable leeway in terms of duration and temperature, in terms of how you can use it as a stressor whereas things like heat don't offer much variable spaceas we say. There isn't a lot of room beyond which you start injuring or even killing people by using heat. So there are a lot of forms of stressors out there, but cold is one that we can titrate, that we can adjust in ways that can allow usto continually build up and or maintain mental toughness. Now, deliberate cold exposure also has many effects on chemicals other than norepinephrine and epinephrine, most notably the neuromodulator dopamine, which is involved in elevating our mood, making us feel energized and enhancing our ability to focus. And that has a lot to do with how dopamine engages usin motivated states, tends to narrow our thinking in our behavior into a particular trench of goal-directed behavior. If you want to learn more about dopamine, you can learn a lot about dopamine in our episode about dopamine, it's at hubermanlab. com. You can find it, it's a two and a half hour plus kind of deep dive into all things dopamine, focus, motivation, et cetera. Deliberate cold exposure has a very powerful effecton the release of dopamine in our brain and body. And this is one of the main reasons why people continueto do deliberate cold exposure. Basically it makes us feel good and it continues to make us feel goodeven after we get out of the cold environment. In fact, some people would say they don't feel good in the cold environment, it's all stress for them, but afterwards they feel great. One of our previous guests, Dr. Anna Lembke, who's a medical doctor at Stanford University School of Medicine, she's a close colleague of mine, described the use dopamine in her book, Dopamine Nation, an incredible book about addiction and dopamine I should mention. And the use of dopamine elicited by cold water exposureby one of her patients. What I'm referring to is the fact that one of her patients helped themselves get and stay sober off drugsby using deliberate cold exposure to increase dopamine. So a healthier form of dopamine releasethan they were engaged in prior to getting sober. Now, the basis for dopamine releasein response to cold exposure is that the catecholamines, norepinephrine, epinephrine and dopamine tend to be co-releasedby the same sorts of stimuli, but most stressors and in particular things that evoke stress or our feelings of stress internallythat we don't like do not increase dopamine. They only increase norepinephrine and epinephrine, but deliberate cold exposure seems to cause a dramatic increase in dopamine. And this has actually been substantiated in a really beautiful study entitled human physiological responsesto immersion into water of different temperatures. The first author is Sramek. I'm almost certainly pronouncing that poorly and if not incorrectly, S-R-A-M-E-K. This was published in the European Journal of Applied Physiology in the year 2000, really a beautiful study, I love this study. They took people and they had them sit in chairs underwater but their head was out and so they were immersedup to the neck in either of three different temperatures. 32 degrees Celsius, which is 89 degrees Fahrenheit, 20 degrees Celsius, which is 68 degrees Fahrenheit, or 14 degrees Celsius, which is 57. 2 degrees Fahrenheit. So not super cold, but then what they didis they measured people's core body temperature throughout. They measured their metabolism and they looked at serum levelsof things like norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine, and cortisol, serum meaning within the blood. So a really nice and quite thorough study. There were not a huge number of subjects in the study, but nonetheless, it was a very thorough study in terms of the number of variables that they explored. So I just want to briefly highlight some of what they saw or what they observed in this study. First of all, all the groups were in the water of a given temperature for one hour, which is much longer than most of the deliberate cold exposure protocols that anyone is using at home. I mean, maybe you're taking one hour long cold showers, maybe you're getting into the ice bath for an hour although I don't recommend that. I think you'd probably get badly hypothermic or maybeyou're getting into a cold water immersion for some period of time, but I have a hard time imagining that it would be an hourand I don't suggest that if it's very cold. So this study focused on actually somewhat moderately cool temperatures, not what I think most people would consider very, very cold temperatures, but extended the duration for quite a while. So again, 32 degree Celsius, 20 degree Celsius or 14 degree Celsius. Here's what they observed. The group that was immersed up to the neck in 32 degrees Celsius, that is 89 degrees Fahrenheit, water did not experience a shift in metabolism nor a significant increase in dopamine, norepinephrine or these other catecholamines. The group that was in 20 degree Celsius, meaning 68 degree Fahrenheit, water for an hour experienced a 93% increasein metabolic rate, which is remarkable given that the water wasn't that coldand yet an hour is a pretty long time to be in there. And again, it speaks to the dramatic effectof heat transfer that water has, which I mentioned earlier, as opposed to being out in the air at 68 degrees, it would certainly not cause that increase in metabolic rate. The group that was at 14 degrees Celsius, meaning 57. 2 degrees Fahrenheit, water for an hour experienced a 350% increase in metabolism. So huge increases in metabolism. Now the most interesting data to me, at least in terms of mental effects of deliberate cold exposure, were that the plasma or serum levels of norepinephrinein the blood increased 530%. These are huge increases in norepinephrineso it suggests that this is a stressful stimulus at least neurochemically speaking, stressful, despite the fact that it's not super super cold, although 57. 2 degrees Fahrenheit, 14 degrees Celsius it's not a warm environment, but it's not a ultra, ultra cold environment, but an hour is a very long time to be in there. The subjects also experienced a 250% increasein dopamine concentrations, which while not 530% as it was with norepinephrineis still a very large increase in baseline levels of dopamine. And what was interesting is that those increases in dopaminepersisted for a very long period of time afterwards, even out to two hours. And they stopped the study after 120 minutes of getting out of the cold, but nonetheless, these increases in norepinephrine are huge and long lasting and these increases in dopamineare very large and long lasting. And I do believe that these documented effects in humansexplain much of the enhancement of attention and of feelings of wellbeing and mood that people typically experienceafter doing deliberate cold exposure. And the reason I say that is thatif you were to go back to the episode that I did on dopamine, or you were to go back to the episode that I did with Dr. Anna Lembke on addiction and dopamine, what you would find is that increases in dopamine of the sort evoked by deliberate cold exposureare actually very similar to the kinds of increases in dopamine that are elicited by things like nicotineor from other behaviors that are known to be addictive and bad for us because they lead to other effects on the brainand body that we simply don't want. And yet deliberate cold exposure provided is done safelycan create similar if not greater increases in dopamine that are not just fleeting, that don't just occur during, say the consumption of some deleterious drug or activity, but that are very long lasting and that can be leveragedtoward activities other than deliberate cold exposure. So I want to emphasize this. I'm not suggesting that people do deliberate cold exposure for an hour a day. And unfortunately there are not many studies yetexploring how shorter colder temperature environment exposure, say one minute or three minutesor six minutes at 55 degrees or at 50 degrees, whether or not that leads to similar, greater or reduced levels of dopamine in the brain and body. And yet almost everybody who does deliberate cold exposure will say yeah, it was stressful. I didn't enjoy it, or I eventually grew to like it, but that I always feel better afterwardsand then that feeling last a very long period of time. And I think it's almost certain that those experiences that people reportrelate to these increases in dopamine and in concert with the increases in norepinephrinealso explain the other effect that's commonly reported, which is an enhancement in mental acuity and the ability to focus. Now, here we can extrapolate to the study that I discussed at the early part of the episode, where I was talking about the use of short 15 minute exercise, kind of moderate intensity exercise and how that was shown to increase levels of energyand mental acuity in these working memory, visual attention tasks. And there, again, we have to assume somewhatbecause they weren't doing neurochemical measurements, but we can reasonably assume that those improvementsin cognitive performance were due at least in part to the increase in catecholamines known to a company, moderate intensity zone two cardio. So what you're starting to see here is a theme. The theme is that virtually any stimulusthat delivers more norepinephrine, epinephrine and dopamine to our system will sharpen our mental acuity and elevate our moodand will do so for some period of time. Deliberate cold exposure, it turns out, is a very potent way to increase these catecholamines, this category of chemicals and thereby to improve mood, mental acuity and levels of alertness. And as we'll next see, it not only has that effect, which can be very beneficial for many peoplein a bunch of different circumstances, but it also has the positive effects that many people seekin terms of metabolism, in lowering inflammation in the body and other physiological effects as well. And forgive me, I was almost ready to move on to effects of deliberate cold exposure on metabolismand inflammation and so forth, but I neglected to point out one of the other very interesting aspects of the studyshowing deliberate cold exposure can increase in norepinephrine and dopamine, which is that they observed no significant increasesin the stress hormone cortisol and that is both surprising, interesting, and importantbecause what it means is that the quality of stress that deliberate cold exposure is creating in the bodyis likely to be one of what we call use stress. Hans Selye, the great physiologist, won a Nobel Prize for distinguishing between distress, which is stress in the brain and bodythat causes the release of things like cortisol along with the other catecholamines, and that we experience as negative happening to usand can lead to negative health outcomes. And he distinguished that from eustress, which was stress that we now understandis associated with increases in things like norepinephrine and dopamine, but no increases or minimal increasesin cortisol, and that can lead to positive health outcomes. So it appears that deliberate cold exposure can createwhat we call or what Hans Selye called eustress. In other words, it can create a condition in the brainand body in which we are stressing ourselves, we are training up resilience, and yet we are creating a neurochemical milieuthat actually has many health benefits. Now I'd like to shift our attention to the effects of deliberate cold exposure on metabolism.",12022.0,2506.0,,"What are the effects of deliberate cold exposure on dopamine and norepinephrine levels in the body, and how do they relate to mental acuity and mood?

"Cold Exposure & Metabolism, Brown Fat:","And I'd like to start by detailing a study that was performed on humans and published just at the end of last year. The title of the study is altered brown fat thermoregulation, and enhanced cold induced thermogenesisin young, healthy winter swimming men. And I should point out that while the study was only performed on male subjects, there's no reason to think that the effects that they discovered would only pertain to men. I would hope that they would also do a study on womenat some point in the future, but the effects that they describe are very basic core physiological processes. What they did is they looked at at deliberate cold exposure in this group of young men, and they used that 11 minute threshold per week. So in other words, they had them get into cold water for approximately 11 minutes per week. And again, that's 11 minutes total per week. They divided that into two sessionsalthough in speaking with the first author of this study, Dr. Susanna Søberg, I learned that it probably is not importantthat it be two sessions, it could be three or even four sessions, as long as it reaches that 11 minute threshold. What they discovered was that by going into these cold environments, in this case cold water immersion up to the neck, for 11 minutes total per week, that these men experienced increasesin so-called brown fat thermogenesis, I'll talk more about what that is in a moment, and increases in core body temperaturethat translate to increases in core body metabolism. Now, the overall increases in core body metabolismthat they experienced were not extremely large. They were statistically significant, but they weren't extremely large. However, the changes in brown fat storesare perhaps what's most interesting about this study and I'll tell you why. The metabolic increases of deliberate cold exposureare both acute meaning happening in the short term. When you get into the cold and immediately after, one does experience an increase in core metabolism, you burn some calories, in other words, and while those might not be very significant increases, or I should say they can be statistically significant, but they are not enormously large numbers of calories burned, the longer lasting effects of deliberate cold exposureon metabolism seem to take place by changes that occur in the types of fat that we store in our bodyand the way that that fat impacts our metabolism at other times throughout the 24 hour cycle. This actually has a somewhat anecdotal basis, in particular in Scandinavia. I don't speak Swedish nor I speak Danish, nor do I speak Norwegian, but I do have Danish relativesand they were able to help me decipher a common Swedish saying, which essentially translates to the fact that in preparation for the summer, they say, one should expose themselves to warm environments so that one is comfortable in warm environmentsin the summer. That's one half of this traditional Swedish and also Danish saying. The other half of this traditional Danish-Swedish saying is that in preparation for winter, in order to not feel too cold in cold environments, one should prepare for those in the fallby not wearing a jacket and exposing one's self to cold environments. Now, of course, this is just anecdotal cultural lore, but it actually has a physiological basis, which is by exposing oneself to cold environmentson a repeated basis in anticipation of exposure to more extreme cold environments, one can feel more comfortable in those extreme cold environments. And that's exactly what they observedin this study by Søberg et al. The men felt more comfortable in extreme coldif they had trained through deliberate cold exposure, which might not seem surprising at all, but based on what we talked about earlier, whereby deliberate cold exposure evokes this discomfortand this experience of norepinephrine release, at least in the short term, then you would say, well, shouldn't that deliberate cold exposure also make them feel uncomfortable like they really want to get out? Well, that is truein the beginning of a deliberate cold exposure protocol, meaning in the first week or in the second weekor the third week, but what one finds and what you will find if you do deliberate cold exposure consistently is that you will thenbecome more comfortable at cold temperatures away from the deliberate cold exposure. So whereas you might have previously been the person who is always cold in the room with air conditioning, or always seeking a sweater, always wanting to bundle up, you will be more comfortable in those cold environments. And the reason for that is well substantiatedfrom this study and from animal studies whereby deliberate cold exposureconverts one particular kind of fat cell, the white fat cell, which is a very low metabolic output cell. It's basically a storage site for energy in the body fat cells to a different type of fat cell, which is the beige fat cell called beige because it's actually beige or slightly brownunder the microscope, or even to brown fat cells, which are very dark under the microscope and darkbecause they contain mitochondria and are very metabolically and thermogenetically active. In other words, white fat doesn't burn many calories. It's basically a storage site. It's a bank account for energy. It's filled with lipids, and those lipids can be used if the body needs energyand if it goes into a caloric deficit. Beige fat and brown fat acts as sort of a furnaceor the sort of fat that you would find in a kindle, a fuel that can increase core body temperature. So beige fat and brown fat is very good at raising our metabolism and helps burn white fat. Now of course, it does that only in the context of a caloric deficit, but it can actually help create that caloric deficit. Having more beige fat and brown fatcan increase your overall core metabolism, in other words, the number of calories that you burn per day, and therefore the number of calories that you need to either maintain or to lose weight. The simple translation of this is that getting into cold water for a total of 11 minutes, perhaps more, but at least 11 minutes per week divided into two or four sessions can increase your core metabolism in partby increasing your beige and brown fat stores. And we know how that works at least in animal modelsand there's now reason to suspect that the exact same mechanisms are occurring in humans. The primary way in which deliberate cold exposure convertswhite fat cells into these more metabolically thermogenetically active metabolism increasingbeige and brown fat cells is because norepinephrinereleased when we get into the cold binds to receptors on the surface of white fat cells and activatesdownstream pathways such as UCP1, so this is an uncoupling protein one, that acts on the mitochondrial metabolism of cells and increases the mitochondrial output of those cellsand the mitochondrial density of those cells. In other words, it takes a cell that has a kind of a weak engineor no engine for generating energy. Although every cell has some mitochondria, it takes cells that have very few mitochondriaand increases the engine size. It kind of stokes the furnace of those particular cellsand actually can change gene expression in those cells. So that's what's really interesting. Deliberate cold exposure causes increases in norepinephrine. which bind to receptors on the surfaces of white fat cells, which triggers the release of things like UCP1. It also causes the release of things like P-part gamma, and co-factor PGC1. I'm going to refer you to a review if you want to learn more about these. For those of you that don't want to learn more, all you need to know is that the downstream of all thatare increases in mitochondria and metabolism and actual genetic changes in the white fat cellsthat convert them into beige and brown fat cells. This is especially important for adultsbecause babies and young children actually don't havethe ability to shiver or they have a less robust capacity to shiver. Very small babies really can't shiverso they have a lot of brown fat in order to keep them warm. Young children eventually develop the ability to shiverand maintain these brown fat stores, mainly around the clavicles, the heart, the upper spine, and in the upper back. And it's no coincidence that kids can often run around with a minimal of clothing and be comfortable in environments that adults would be cold in. As life goes on, we tend to lose beige and brown fat, but this mechanism that I'm referring topoints to the plasticity of white fat, meaning the ability for white fat to actually convert its identity into this metabolically thermogeneticallyenhancing form of beige and brown fat. So deliberate cold exposure is a terrific wayto increase your core metabolism and oftentimes critics will say, well, the increase in metabolism isn't that significantalthough I do want to point out again, the 93% and 350% increases in metabolismfrom that previous study. But critics then will say, well, that doesn't really translate to that big of a caloric burnduring the deliberate cold exposure. But to that, you should say, ah, but that's only limiting your opticsto just a portion of the effects of deliberate cold exposure because deliberate cold exposure can also convert white fat to beige fat and brown fatand lead to these more lasting increases in metabolism. So for any of you interested in increasing your metabolismand or being comfortable in cold environments and or being comfortable in terms ofbeing able to combat stress mentally, deliberate cold exposure, I do believe is a powerful tool. And there is simply no reason why you couldn't and shouldn't use the same protocols that I described earlierfor building resilience to increase metabolism. Provided you're hitting that 11 minute per week threshold, you ought to be stimulating both mechanism increases in resilience and increases in core metabolism. As I mentioned earlier, most of the detailed studies on the conversion of white fat to beige fat and brown fat through the use of coldhave been done in animal models, but the human data are starting to emerge. And if you'd like to do the deep dive into these mechanisms, things like UCP1, P-part gamma, et cetera, there's a beautiful review that was published recentlyin the journal cell, which is one of the three apex journals, nature, science, cell. And the title of that paper is adipose tissue plasticityin health and disease. I love this review. It has beautiful diagrams detailing all of the pathwaysfrom cold to norepinephrine through UCP1 downstream of things like cyclic AMP. If none of those names mean anything to you, don't worry about it. You certainly don't need to know these mechanisms to benefit from deliberate cold exposure protocols. If those names do mean something to you, or you are interested in exploring the downstream effectsof deliberate cold exposure and something else that's really nice that's covered in this paper is how deliberate cold exposure interactswith fasted states and fed states. I think you'll also find this review very interesting. I don't want to go too deeply into fasted states and fed states right now, suffice to say that when we are fasted, meaning when we have an eaten for some period of time, our baseline levels of norepinephrineand epinephrine are already elevated. And so cold exposure at those timesought to have an even greater effect on metabolism and resilience and so on. So for you fasters or your intermittent fasters out there, if you really want to get fancy, you can do your deliberate cold exposure when you are fasted. I certainly wouldn't recommend doing itwith a very full stomach in any case. And as I mentioned before on this podcast, intermittent fasting is, but one way, and certainly there are other ways to limit total caloric intake for sake of maintainingor losing weight if that's your goal. I know many people are using and benefit from intermittent fasting, however, and so it certainly can be combined with deliberate cold exposures in order to get even greater increasesin norepinephrine and epinephrine. So for those of you that are primarily interested in using deliberate cold exposure",12213.0,2466.0,"This study looked at deliberate cold exposure in young, healthy men and found that by going into cold water immersion up to the neck for 11 minutes total per week, these men experienced increases in brown fat thermogenesis and core body temperature, which translated to increases in core body metabolism. Deliberate cold exposure can convert white fat cells into more metabolically and thermogenetically active beige and brown fat cells, leading to more lasting increases in metabolism. This is a powerful tool for increasing metabolism, being comfortable in cold environments, and combating stress mentally. The mechanisms behind this conversion are well-documented in animal models and are starting to emerge in human data.

"Tool: Caffeine, Dopamine & Cold Exposure:","to increase dopamine levels in your brain and body, you can also do a combined protocolwhereby you ingest caffeine 60 to 120 minutes before the deliberate cold exposure. This is based on a study that I've talked about before entitled caffeine increases striatal dopamine D-2, D-3 receptor availability in the human brain. And as the title suggests, this study was done on humans, looking at the density and or efficacy of these dopamine receptorsin an area of the brain called the striatum, which is involved in planning in action and also suppressing planning in action. It's involved very closely with whether or not we can engage in behavior and withhold behavior, the so-called go and no go ways in the brain. Dopamine plays a critical role in that and many other things as well as you now know. So why would you want to ingest caffeine 60 to 120 minutes before deliberate cold exposure?Well, as I talked about earlier, dopamine can increase quite substantiallyin response to deliberate cold exposure, but dopamine on its own doesn't do anything, it has to bind to receptorsand this paper shows quite definitively that ingesting caffeine in this case, it was 300 milligram dose of caffeine, which is about the dose of caffeine in two or three cups of coffee, it depends on the strength of the coffee, of course, but it's not an outrageous amount of caffeine, that increases the density and or efficacyof these receptors, which you would allow that dopamine to have its greatest effect. And for those of you that want to get really, really fancy, I suppose you could do this fasted so you get the further increase in norepinephrine, then you get the dopamine increase from the cold exposure, the binding of the dopamine. Although I do want to point out that at some point, you start layering together enough protocols that you would to be spending your entire day trying to get this dopamine pulse and I would hope that you would have other activitiesthat you would engage in, but if you're getting up in the morning and you're fasted because you haven't eaten all nightand you have a cup of coffee, and then 60 minutes later, you take your cold shower or two hours later, you do your cold immersion or your cold shower, you would be layering together these different mechanisms of dopamine receptors, epinephrine and so forth in a way that at least to me, doesn't seem incompatible with having some other lifelike going to school and having relationships, et cetera. And this increase in dopamine, particularly in the striatum is not a trivial one. I do want to point out as the authors do that preclinical studies have shown that increases in striatal dopamineinduced by things like modafinil, which is used to treat ADHD and treat narcolepsy, is necessary for their wake promoting actions. What this really says is that just having elevated levelsof dopamine from a drug or from an ice bath, or what have you is not sufficient to get the effects of dopamine, you really need the receptors to be available and you need those receptors to be available in the appropriate densityand you need those receptors to be available in the appropriate density in the striatum in particular. So I think there are a number of reasons whyif it's compatible with the other aspects of your health, cause of course always you have to consider this on a background of cardiovascular healthand blood pressure, et cetera, that ingesting a cup or two of coffee an hour before your ice bath may be fasted as wellcould be quite beneficial for increasing dopamine over quite extended periods of time. A couple of key points that you'll want to pay attention to",3641.0,754.0,":

- Ingesting caffeine 60 to 120 minutes before deliberate cold exposure can increase dopamine levels in the brain and body.
- Dopamine needs to bind to receptors to have its greatest effect, and caffeine can increase the density and efficacy of these receptors.
- Layering together different mechanisms of dopamine receptors and epinephrine can be beneficial for increasing dopamine, but it should be compatible with other aspects of your health.
- Elevated levels of dopamine are not sufficient to get the effects of dopamine, you need the receptors to be available in the appropriate density, particularly in the striatum.
- Consider this on a background of cardiovascular health and blood pressure.","What are the potential benefits of ingesting caffeine before deliberate cold exposure, according to Andrew Huberman and Susanna Søberg, and how does caffeine affect dopamine receptors?",Cold Exposure,Andrew Huberman and Susanna Søberg,90,1685290241
"Tools: Increasing Metabolism w/Cold – The Søberg Principle, Shivering:","in thinking about deliberate cold exposure and metabolism. In the Søberg study, they also explored the use of sauna and how to use sauna, meaning deliberate heat in conjunction with cold. We are going to do an entire episode about the use of heatfor health and performance. So that is not the focus now, however, it does raise an important point that we do need to address at this moment, which is if you are using saunaor if you are taking warm showers or if you are simply using deliberate cold exposureof any kind, should you get into the heat afterward or before or not at all?And this is where we can point to the so-called Søberg principle, at least I call it the Søberg principle, the Søberg principle named after first author of this study, I referred to earlier, Dr. Susanna Søberg. In science, it is appropriate to take a key piece of data and call it a principleif in fact it translates to something larger, which I believe it does. It is generally not appropriate for peopleto name a principle after themselves although there are a few scientists that have done that. So I have named it the Søberg principle, but I did that to give it appropriate credit to Dr. Susanna Søberg, who discovered that and pointed out quite appropriately, that to achieve the greatest increases in metabolismthrough deliberate cold exposure, you want to force yourself to reheat on your ownafter the deliberate cold exposure, meaning you wouldn't want to go from the cold shower to a hot shower or from the cold shower to a sauna. Rather if you were going to start with a hot shower or you're going to start with a sauna that you would end with the cold, and then you would reheat naturally. Now I personally take a cold shower a few times a weekor do cold immersion and because I'm not specifically focused on increasing metabolism, although I probably should be, that's not what I'm using it for now, I will take a hot shower afterwards and in doing so, I'm short circuitingsome of the further metabolic increases that I would achieve were I to just end with the cold. So the Søberg principle is if you want to increase your metabolism, end with cold, and we can take this a step further and say that if you want to use deliberate cold exposureto increase metabolism, that you should make sure that you get to the point where you shiver. And the reason in for this is that there are a series of studies, but in particular, one study published in the journal Nature, excellent journal in the year 2018, showing that deliberate cold exposure that evokes shiveringfrom the muscles causes the release of a molecule called succinate from the musclesand that succinate plays a key role in activating brown fat thermogenesis, which you now have heard about and understand as critical to the increases in metabolism caused by deliberate cold exposure. So what this means is if you want to increase your metabolism, end on cold, that's a Søberg principle and as best you can, try and get to the point where you are shivering either when you are in the cold exposureor immediately afterwards. Now one efficient way to do this is to, for instance, you could get into the cold shower for a minute or two minutes or three minutes, uncomfortably cold, but safe to stay in. Remember that's our general rule of thumb. Then turn off the water and stand there, make sure that you're not holding yourself close to your body, you're not hugging yourself to try and keep yourself warm, but rather your limbs are extended at your sides. And then if that fails to induce shiverthan to turn on the cold water again, and then turn it off again, so alternating perhaps a minute to three minutesof cold exposure followed by a minute to three minutes of drying out in air and going back into the cold exposure, et cetera. I can tell you this from experience, this is a pretty brutal protocol. If you have never tried getting into an ice bathor cold water immersion or shower for one minute and then getting out and trying to stand there with your arms extended in cool or cold air for one minute, and then getting back into the cold shower or water immersion, you are in for an experience becauseeven for those of you that are pretty shiver resistant, you'll find that it is much, much harder to get out of that cold water and stand there arms extendedand drying off by evaporation, which further draws heat from the body than it is to wrap yourself in a towel, get in a warm shower or a sauna. So there's certainly no requirement to end on cold. There's certainly no requirement to induce shiver, but if your primary goalis to induce increases in metabolism, both in the short term and in the long term, following the cold exposure, well then you'll want to end on cold and you'll want to find a way to shiverprovided that the level of cold that you're exposing yourself to is still safe for you overall.",4869.0,1033.0,"The Søberg principle, named after Dr. Susanna Søberg, suggests that to achieve the greatest increases in metabolism through deliberate cold exposure, you should force yourself to reheat on your own after the exposure. This means that if you want to use deliberate cold exposure to increase metabolism, you should end with cold and try to get to the point where you are shivering either when you are in the cold exposure or immediately afterwards. This is because shivering causes the release of a molecule called succinate from the muscles, which plays a key role in activating brown fat thermogenesis. One efficient way to induce shivering is to alternate between cold exposure and drying out in air. However, there is no requirement to end on cold or induce shivering, and the level of cold exposure should still be safe for you overall.","What is the Søberg principle and how does it suggest achieving the greatest increases in metabolism through deliberate cold exposure, according to Andrew Huberman and Susanna Søberg?",Cold Exposure,Andrew Huberman and Susanna Søberg,90,1685290446
Norepinephrine & Fat Cells:,"So up until now, I've been talking about deliberate cold exposure as a potent stimulus for the release of norepinephrinein the brain and body and indeed it is, but the way I've been describing it has been in the contextof circulating plasma levels of norepinephrine, meaning circulating within the blood. What I haven't mentioned, but is absolutely true is that the fat cells themselvesactually receive input from neurons. So there are neurons that release norepinephrinein response to cold, directly into the fat. So I want to give you this picture of how the architectureof all this works, because I think it can help you navigate and indeed build better deliberate cold exposure protocols. Your adrenal glands release norepinephrine and epinephrine. Your brain has sites within it like the locus coeruleusthat release norepinephrine and epinephrine, but there are also neurons within your skin that sense coldand other neurons that can directly release norepinephrine into the fat stores and cause those white fat cellsto convert to beige and brown fat. And I think this particular aspect of our physiology is often overlooked in studies. And when people say, oh, well the increases in metabolism aren't that great, the circulating levels of norepinephrine, those are very large, but they're very transient and so on, that fails to understand that neuronsthat actually sense cold are in a position to communicate via other neurons directly to the fat cellsand release norepinephrine into those fat cells, which as I pointed out earlier, set off a huge set of immediateand long term cascades of even gene expression changes. So the picture that I'd like you to have in your mindis that when you get into the cold, yes, of course you experience that as a experience ofI don't want to do this, I'm going to overcome this, I'm going to climb over these mental walls that represent adrenaline release in my brain and body, but also that your fat cells are receiving signals, norepinephrine signals that are changing those fat cellsand the way that they metabolize energy. Now I'd like to shift our attention to the use of deliberate cold exposure",2144.0,455.0,"as a potential therapy for various health conditions. Studies have shown that regular exposure to cold can improve insulin sensitivity, increase metabolism, and even reduce inflammation. However, it's important to note that there are potential hazards associated with cold exposure, such as hypothermia and frostbite. It's crucial to start slowly and gradually increase exposure time and intensity, and to always listen to your body's signals. Additionally, individuals with certain health conditions, such as Raynaud's disease or cardiovascular disease, should consult with a healthcare professional before attempting deliberate cold exposure. Overall, deliberate cold exposure can be a powerful tool for improving health, but it should be approached with caution and proper guidance.","What are the potential benefits and hazards associated with deliberate cold exposure, and what precautions should individuals take before attempting it?

"Cold, Physical Performance, Inflammation:","for sake of physical performance. And there are a lot of opinions out there about the use of deliberate cold, whether or not it should be done for instance, before or after exercise, whether or not if done immediately after strength trainingor hypertrophy training, meaning training designed to grow muscles or make them stronger, whether or not it can inhibit that processand so on and so forth. I think today in looking over the literature and trying to bring forward the simplestand most straightforward, and yet scientifically grounded protocols, we can set up some general guidelines that will allow most, if not, all of you to still extract the benefits of deliberate cold exposure on physical performancewithout getting too neurotic about the exact timing, but for sake of discussionand because it's a prominent theme in many online communities, let's just start with the big one out there, meaning the question of whether or not doing an ice bath or doing deliberate cold exposure or taking a cold showerafter strength slash hypertrophy training, meaning training designed to increase strengthand or I should say the size of muscles will somehow short circuit or diminish that process, whether or not it will reduce or eliminate those strength gains and hypertrophy gains. And the short answer that I was able to arrive aton the basis of a review article that I'll talk about in a moment and some other studies as well, is that if your main goal is hypertrophy and strength, it is probably best to avoid cold water immersion and ice bath immersion in the four hoursimmediately following that strength and or hypertrophy training. Again, if your main goal is to achieve hypertrophyor strength or some combination of those, probably best to avoid cold water immersion up to the neckor ice bath immersion up to the neck immediately after strength and hypertrophy trainingand extending out to about four hours after that training. If you're really neurotic about this, then perhaps you'd want to move the cold water exposure to a different day entirely, but it all depends on how neurotically attached you are to getting every last bit of strength and hypertrophy. And if that's your goal, terrific, well then probably moving the cold exposure four hoursor more away from that training is going to be necessary for you. Now you'll notice I did not talk about cold showersand the reason I did not talk about cold showers is that there simply are not very many studiesof deliberate cold exposure through cold showers for the reasons I talked about at the beginning of the episode. It's hard for me to imagine that taking a brief cold shower after a strength or hypertrophy training sessionwould completely reverse or short circuit the effects of that strength and hypertrophy training. But again, if you're neurotically attachedto getting every last bit of strength and hypertrophy out of your training sessions, then by all means, err on the side of caution and wait four hours or more to do your cold shower just as you would wait four hoursor more to do your cold water immersion. Now there are nice data pointing to the fact that doing cold water immersion after a hard run, so endurance training, or even sprint and interval training or after a weight workout where your main focusis on performance of those movements or after a skill training workout where your main focus on performance of those movements, that there's no reason to think that that cold water immersion or ice bath or cold showerwould inhibit the progress or the stimulus that would lead to progressthat occurred during that training session. In other words, I don't see any reason based on the literature to avoid deliberate cold exposureimmediately after training, again unless your goal is hypertrophy and strength. And in fact, there's a very nice review recently published on deliberate cold exposureand how it can impact physical performance, whether or not it's done before or after, different types of training and so forth. The paper is entitled impact of cold water immersioncompared with passive recovery, following a single about of strenuous exercise on athletic performance in physically active participants, a systematic review with meta-analysis and meta regression. So this is a meta-analysis of 52 studiesthat looked at a tremendous number of variables and contexts, as you would expect in a meta-analysisof 52 studies. I'm going to read you the conclusions of the study and I will provide a link. We certainly don't have the time to go throughall the details of the study. I will highlight a few specific outcomes that I found particularly interesting, but here I am paraphrasing their conclusions, that cold water immersion, I want to emphasize immersion, not cold showers, but cold water immersion they say was an effective recovery tool after high intensity exercise. They observed positive outcomes, meaning improvements in certain variables, for muscular power, muscular soreness, meaning reduced muscular soreness, increased muscular power, perceived recovery after 24 hours of exercise. However, there were certain forms of exercisethat were not benefited by cold water immersion, such as eccentric exercise, exercise focusing only on the lowering component or the so-called eccentric component of resistance exercise. They saw some very entry dose response relationships for things like endurance training, meaning the longerthe cold exposure post-endurance training, the more improvement in endurance performance, reductions in circulating creatine kinasesand things that relate to muscle damage under certain conditions. At some point in the future, by the way, we'll do an entire episode on creatine and creatine kinase, which are important not just for muscular function, but also for brain function. But the basic takeaway was that cold water immersionperformed after high intensity exercise was beneficial from a number of different standpointsand indicated that shorter duration, cold exposure and lower temperaturescan improve the efficacy of cold water exposure if used after high intensity exercise. There I'm directly pulling from their conclusions. So what this says is that it's not just those longer duration, 30, 45 minute and 60 minute protocolsof cold water immersion that we discussed earlier, but also shorter duration of one minute, three minute, five minute exposures to lower temperatures. Temperatures that would make you psychologicallywant to get out as soon as you possibly can, but again that you can safely stay indone after training really have been shown to improve outcomes in terms of reducing sorenessand improving training efficacy, meaning your ability to get back into training more quicklyand thereby deliver more training stimuli to a given muscle or in your endurance training protocol. Translate to English, what this means is that taking a cold shower or getting into an ice bath or some other form of cold water immersionwithin the immediate minutes or even the immediate hours following your training has been shown to be beneficial. I'm sure a number of you have questions for instance, how long should you be in that cold exposure?Is it the same as the 11 minute threshold described earlier? To be honest with you, there are not enough studies to really pointto the critical threshold for eliminating or reducing delayed onset muscle sorenessor for getting maximal results from power and endurance training, but this study does make a couple of key pointsand here I will just paraphrase. For instance, that cold water immersion is more likely to positively influencemuscular power performance, to reduce muscle soreness, to reduce serum creatine kinase, and to improve perceived recovery after high intensity exercise, as compared with passive recovery. This can be translated to cold water exposure after training is beneficial and probably betterthan passive recovery from a number of standpoints. In addition, they say that dose response relationshipsmeaning the amount and the degree of cold that people were exposed to and how often they did thatin particular in lower temperature cold immersion. So these would be the sorts of cold immersion protocolsthat are one minute or two minutes, three minutes, maybe five minutes, but that one couldn't stay in there longerbecause it feels stressful and one wants to get out. Maybe more effective after high intensity exercisefor removal of serum creatine kinase as well that these shorter durationcold water immersion approaches may be more effective after high intensity endurance performance as well. So all of this can be translated to say that unless your main goal is hypertrophy and strength, that cold exposure, ideally cold immersion and cold water ice bath, but if you don't have access to that, then cold showers is likely going to be beneficial if done immediately after or in the minutesor hours after your training, especially high intensity training. One particularly nice thing about this meta-analysisis that it included some studies that involve the use of cooling packs. So again, vests that can essentially ice packsand indeed even cryotherapy chambers and so on. There's a nice table in the study if you want to get really detailed and goand look specifically at those studies, I invite you to do that. We'll put a link to this study in the captionfor this episode, but all in all, what this study shows is that deliberate cold exposurecan be very useful for recovery likely through reductions in inflammation, in muscle and connective tissue. And while this study did not look specifically at the mechanisms of reduced inflammationcaused by deliberate cold exposure, those mechanisms are somewhat known. There are a number of studies that have pointed to the factthat deliberate cold and cold generally can reduce inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, interleukin six. It can increase anti-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 10 and so on. Without getting into all those details, I think it's sufficient to say that if you are somebody who experiencesa lot of delayed onset muscle soreness, taking a cold shower after your training or getting into a cold immersion after your training, even if it's a few hours later ought to help. And if you are doing particularly intense training, then you probably want to ratchet up the number of cold exposure sessions that you're doingeven if those have to be done on separate days from your training, because a lot of the inflammatory effects of training, endurance and strength training are actually occurring some hours away from the training stimulus. So it's not just that inflammation goes upradically during training, which it often can, but that it can occur even in the days and even weeks afterwards, depending how intense and how long duration that training is. So deliberate cold exposure is very powerfulas an anti-inflammatory tool. Now I'd like to emphasize the topic that we touched on at the beginning of the episode,",10998.0,2096.0,,"What are the general guidelines for using deliberate cold exposure for physical performance, and how does it affect hypertrophy and strength training?

Hyperthermia & Glabrous Skin Cooling:,"which are those glabrous skin surfaces, the hands, the upper face, and the bottoms of the feet through which heatis especially good at leaving the body. And another way of putting that is that one can coolthe body much more efficiently through the glabrous skin surfaces. Now, if you want to understand all of the sciencebehind this and all of the various applications, I invite you to please listen to the episodethat I did with Dr. Craig Heller, again, in the biology department at Stanford. For sake of this episode, I'm just going to detail a couple of findings from his laboratory. The first one, dealing with exercise induced hyperthermia, because I think this is very interesting and it can even save lives if you understand the way this works. There's a particular paper that focuses on this, and we will put a link to this as well. The title of this paper is novel applicationof chemical cold packs for treatment of exercise induced hyperthermia, a randomized control trial. This is a pretty brutal study, brutal for the subjects that is. This study involved was having subjects walk on a treadmill at a pretty significant incline and anywherefrom nine to 17% wearing a substantial amount of clothing that was not well ventilatedand the room was kept to 40 degrees Celsius, which is 104 degrees Fahrenheit. This is definitely not something to do at home. This study was designed to induce hyperthermia, which as I mentioned earlier, can be quite dangerous. And they compared two types of cooling. In the first form of cooling that they call traditional cooling, they had ice packs on their neck, in their armpits and in their groin. And in the other group, there was the so-called glabrous skin cooling. So the palms, the soles of the feet, which were actually so they were cooling inside the bootsor inside of gloves and on the upper portion of the face. And the basic takeaway of this study is that by cooling the glabrous skin, the subjects were able to sustain this walking on these inclined treadmills for much longerthan were the people who received traditional cooling. And also the return to baseline temperaturewas much faster in the glabrous skin cooling group. So how this translates to the real worldis that if ever you are hyperthermic or someone else's hyperthermic, one way to cool them down quickly is to coolthese palmer glabrous, soles of the feet glabrous and upper portion of the face glabrous portions of the bodyusing cool rags, using ice packs or using any number of different cold objects or temperatures. One key thing, if you're going to use glabrous skin cooling, is that whatever you use to cool those surfacescannot be so cold that it causes vasoconstriction. Because as I mentioned earlier, the arterio-venous anastomoses these portals of arteries directly to veins that exist only in these glabrous skin surfaces, the way that they're able to cool the body and essentially pass cool into the body although that's not really what they're doing, they're actually extracting heat from the body to be technical, they're extracting heat from the body, the only way they can do that is if those veins don't collapse and veins will collapseif they are made very, very cold. So if you want to use glabrous skin cooling to offset hyperthermiaor for the other forms of performance, which we'll talk about in a moment, you need to use a cool object or surfacethat is not so cold that it causes vasoconstriction. And this can be a little bit tough to dial in, meaning it can be tough to identify such an object. And for that reason, Dr. Heller and some of his colleagues have developeda commercial product called the CoolMitt. You can actually go to their website, coolmitt. com. I don't have any financial or other relationship to them. I know they've been developing this technology for some period of time. It involves a glove that you put your hand into, it circulates water of a given temperature and it does so, and does so at a tempera or that is sure to notcause vasoconstriction of the palm. And you may be asking, how can you just put your hand into one gloveand have this work? Well, that's how powerful these glabrous skin surfaces are. Even just by cooling one palm, the core body temperature drops radically. Now that's their commercial technology. I know that some people out there have started to experiment with a home version of this, which would be taking a package for instanceof frozen blueberries or some other cold drink or cold metal object, and actually bringing it into the gymor out on a run. There are even people who are now developing cooled psych bicycle handles for long rides. This might seem a little kooky or crazy to you, but as you'll soon hear in the study I'm about to describe, the increases in enduranceand in the volume of strength training that people can conduct if they appropriately cooltheir body through these glabrous skin portals is actually quite significant. So again, as it relates to hyperthermia, if someone is overheating by all means, try and get them out of that heat, get them to stop exercising, you can die from hyperthermia, try and cool the bottoms of the feet, the palms of their handsand the upper portion of their face. That does not mean it would be a bad ideato put cold water on the top of their head. That probably would also help and perhaps on their neck. What is probably not going to be a good idea is to dothe more standard thing of draping someone in cold towels on the surface of their body because as I mentioned, the beginning of the episode, that thermostat in the hypothalamus, the medial preoptic area will typically react to thatby increasing core body temperature further. The effects of glabrous skin cooling on physical performance",5745.0,1231.0,"Glabrous skin surfaces, such as the palms, soles of the feet, and upper face, are efficient at cooling the body. Cooling these areas can help offset hyperthermia and improve physical performance. In a study, subjects who received glabrous skin cooling were able to sustain exercise on inclined treadmills for longer and returned to baseline temperature faster than those who received traditional cooling. However, it's important to use a cool object or surface that is not so cold that it causes vasoconstriction, which can collapse veins. A commercial product called the CoolMitt has been developed to cool the palms without causing vasoconstriction. Some people have also experimented with home versions of cooling objects, such as frozen blueberries or cooled bicycle handles.","What is the Søberg Principle, and how can it be applied to improve physical performance during exercise?

Tool: Palmar Cooling & Endurance:,"are truly remarkable provided the glabrous skin cooling is done correctly. And I want to point out that the main degree of effectis on volume or the ability to do more work. And I want to point this out because I think that many people, certainly in the exercise science community, but even in the general public, when they hear about some of these effects that are measured in the laboratory, they sort of look at those effects a bit of scans and they think, well, that's not possible. Effects for instance, that have been documented showing doubling or tripling of the number of dips that one can do in a relatively short amount of timeor doubling of the number of pullups one can do or 14% increases in strength or even comparable degreesin increase in weight training output to people who are on performance enhancing drugs, et cetera, et cetera. Part of the confusion is that the effects of proper palmer cooling, because it almost always is done by palmer cooling and less often in these experimentsby cooling of the bottoms of the feet and the upper portion of the face, but those effects tend to be the ability to do more workover time and just to illustrate some of the major effects that the Heller lab is seen and they are document entered in this manuscriptthat I'll share with you in a moment. The typical protocol is to have people come inand do some endurance training so running on a treadmill and to have a condition whereone group is actually doing palmer cooling while they are on a bike or on a treadmill and inevitably the outcome is that they can do more work. They can pedal further at a given speed, or they can run longer at a given speed than peoplewho are not doing palmer cooling or who are receiving cooling by way of cold compress to the back of the neck or ice packto the armpits, et cetera. So the effects of palmer cooling are very clear and very robust. And in the context of endurance exercise almost always allow people to do more work, to go longer with less perceived effort and to quit later so to speak. In terms of strength training, they've looked at the capacity to perform sets of dips. So one of the more famous examples of this that Dr. Heller shares in the episode that we did earlier, and that you can find at hubermanlab. com involves someone coming in and doing sets of dips, maybe 40 dips. This person actually could do 40 dips on their first set, then resting for a period of two to three minutes and then doing 35and then resting for a period of two or three minutes, and then doing progressively fewer and fewer and fewer to the point where over a period of time, they add up the total number of dips that they can do and then they have them come back after a period of recovery, so not immediately after, but take a couple of days, come back and do effectively the same protocol, but during their rest periods, they're doing two minutes of palmer cooling, which essentially allows heat to move out of the body, lowering core body temperature in other words. And what they find is that they see enormous increasesin the total number of dips that people can do, but that doesn't mean that the person goes from being able to do 40 dips, to being able to do 50 dips or 60 dips on that first set, what it means is they are able to do 40 on the first set, then 40 on the second, then 38 on the third and so on and so forthso that the total duration of the workout is extended and yet they're doing much more work, even though it takes more time. So that's an important point and I think a point that perhaps wasn't as clearor as clearly made by me in the previous episodes that discuss this topic. For those of you that are interestedin exploring palmer cooling, first of all, I recommend taking a brief glance or even a deep diveinto this study, which is entitled work volume and strength training responses to resistive exerciseimprove with periodic heat extraction from the palm. In this study, they describe big increases in anaerobic, meaning strength training output, things like improvement in dips, improvement in bench press, improvement in pull-ups, et cetera, in human subjects. And it's a really nice study and pointsto some of the protocols that you might be able to adapt in your own setup. For instance, over six weeks of pull up training, palm cooling in between sets improved volume by 144%, and this was in experienced subjects. So that's interesting because a lot of studies of strength training and improvements in hypertrophyand strength are done in inexperienced untrained athletes, which changes the picture somewhatcompared to experienced athletes. They found that strength, meaning the one repetition maximum, increased 22% over 10 weeks in bench press training. And they point to the particularly strong effectsof using palmer cooling when people reach plateaus in endurance and strength training. And there, I think it's an important point. I think that if you're going to explore palmer cooling, it's probably not the sort of thing that you're going to do in every run or in every about of cyclingor in every strength training session, but that it might be used to vastly increase your volumeor vastly increase your endurance in a given session or a set of sessions in order to push through plateaus. A particularly interesting point in light of that is Dr. Heller has observed again and againthat palmer cooling reduces delayed onset muscle soreness, or it can eliminate it entirely. And that's very interest because it also points to the factthat reducing core body temperature may somehow be involved in short circuiting the normal mechanisms of delayed onset muscle soreness. And you might say, well, how would temperature be involved in delayed onset muscle soreness? Well, I want to refer you back to the meta-analysisthat we talked about earlier, where the short duration, very cold temperature exposure after training did indeedreduce delayed onset muscle soreness in part through reduction, excuse me, in creatine kinase. So it's not inconceivable that temperatureand delayed onset muscle soreness are related. And that raises perhaps the most important point, which is the way that palmer cooling can improve performanceby way of reducing core body temperature is known and that is because when one engages in exerciseor muscular output of any kind, strength or endurance exercise, the range of temperatures under which a muscle can performis actually very narrow. There's an enzyme called pyruvate kinase, which is critical to muscle contractionsand pyruvate kinase can only function in a very narrow range of temperatures. If that temperature gets too hot, meaning if the muscle heats up locally, whether or not by running or cycling or swimming or weightlifting, the ability for that muscle to continue to contract is reduced and eventually is short circuited completely. And I think this is a much underexplored or at least a much under discussed aspectof so-called muscular failure or the failure of one to continue to endure in running. So for instance, when you run as compared to a bench press or something, you don't stop running because you can't actually contract the muscles further, but somehow signals about the heating up of muscular tissue are conveyed to the brain. There's a crosstalk there, it's probably bidirectional and people stop, they quit. This is the quitting reflex. In strength training, one can no longer perform a repetition or set of repetitions in partbecause of heating up of the muscle locally. There are other mechanisms as well, of course, and I realize that, but what's very clear from the palmer cooling work is that by simply holding onto a cool object, remember not an object so cold that it constricts the vessels of the palms or constricts the vessels on the bottoms of the feet, but by holding onto a relatively cool object in one or both hands in between sets for two minutes or so, you can very efficiently reduce your core body temperature and in doing so, reduce the temperature of the musclesthat are doing the work, increase the capacity for pyruvate kinase to continue to allow your muscles to contractand thereby allow you to do more volume of endurance and strength training. So a simple protocol that Dr. Heller passed to meis find a relatively cool object. So you could, for instance, fill two bottles with cold water, maybe put a few ice cubes in there.

And then in between sets to put your handsand ideally you'd put the bottoms of your feet, but that's not always feasible in most gyms where they won't let you take off your shoes and so forth, but to put the palms of your hands on that cool surface for a minute or two minutes between setsand then returning to your sets of work. Now, if you are heating up through other mechanismslike you're wearing a stocking cap and you're in a very warm environment, this might not have as potent effect as if you were to do this coolingin a more moderate environment, wearing lighter clothing, et cetera. So by all means warm up to do your exercise, lubricate your joints, and get into a place where you're not going to injure yourself, doing whatever form of exercise you do. But then if you'd like to explore palmer cooling, I know a number of people who've written to me saying they heard about palmer cooling on the episode with Dr. Heller. They've tried this and they see quite excellent results. It does take some discipline. It's one thing to just kind of hang out in the gym and play on your phone in between sets. It's another to do deliberate cooling with your palmsor the bottom of your feet or the upper portion of your face. You might get some weird looks, but of course you'll be the one doing significantly more volume, not experiencing delayed onset muscle soreness and achieving better endurance and strength gains were you to do this properly. Now as a final topic related to the use of deliberate cold exposure for improving health",10154.0,2111.0,"Palmer cooling can significantly improve endurance and strength training by allowing individuals to do more work over time. The effects of proper palmer cooling are measured in the laboratory and have shown to double or triple the number of dips or pull-ups one can do in a short amount of time. Palmer cooling reduces delayed onset muscle soreness and can eliminate it entirely. The ability for muscles to contract is reduced when the muscle heats up locally, and palmer cooling can efficiently reduce core body temperature, allowing individuals to do more volume of endurance and strength training. To explore palmer cooling, find a relatively cool object and put the palms of your hands on it for a minute or two between sets. It takes discipline, but it can significantly improve endurance and strength gains.","According to Andrew Huberman and Susanna Søberg, how can palmer cooling improve endurance and strength training, and what are the benefits of proper palmer cooling?",Cold Exposure,Andrew Huberman and Susanna Søberg,90,1685321747
"Cold Exposure to Groin, Increasing Testosterone:","and performance, I'd like to touch on this theme that exists online, on social media, on YouTube and in various fitness communities of using deliberate cold exposure to the groin, in particular to the testicles, in order to try and increase testosterone. And while this might sound really kooky, indeed this practice exists. Indeed if you were to go onto Amazon, there are actually ice pack underwearthat are being marketed for sake of increasing testosterone. Now, I am not aware of any specific well-controlled studies that show that this indeed works. I can imagine based on what I know about the nervous system, testosterone and cold, et cetera, that there are a couple of mechanisms by which one might experience increases in testosterone as a consequence of deliberate cold exposure. First off, let me say there is no reason why you would have to apply these ice packs in the way that I just described. One could of course take a cold shower. One could of course use cold immersion of various kinds, and you're still going to get that exposure of the groin and the testicles to cold. Now I should point out that people do report at least anecdotally increases in testosterone as a consequence of this practice and I have to imagine that they are measuring their serum testosterone, that they're not just guessing that their testosterone went up. If you know of a study exploring this directly, please let me know, put in the comment section on YouTube, or even just email me. We have a email that you can find it, hubermanlab. com. Please email me the reference. I wasn't able to find a reference, but I can imagine two reasonably plausible mechanisms by which deliberate cold exposure to the groin, in particular the testicles, would increase testosterone. The first is somewhat direct, which is that anytime you cool a body surface, that if it's cold enough, you're going to get vasoconstriction. And then subsequently you're going to get a rebound increase in vasodilation, meaning you're going to constrict the blood vessels in that area. And then after the cold is removed, there's going to be more blood flow to that area. And of course, blood flow relates to organ health and tissue health generally. So perfusion of that region and the gonads to be specific with additional blood, you could imagine in some ways increasing testosterone, that's reasonably plausible. The other probably more likely mechanism relates to the dopamine increases caused by cold exposure that we talked about earlier. Again, anytime you have a somewhat stressful stimulus, but in particular with cold exposure, it seems that the catecholamines, norepinephrine, epinephrine and dopamine all increaseand dopamine is known to be in the pathway that can stimulate testosterone. And so while there isn't a direct relationship between dopamine stimulating testosterone, there is an interesting pathway way wherebydopamine increases can trigger increases in things like luteinizing hormone, which can trigger increases in testosteroneas well as estrogen for that matter. So I know that there are a lot of people out there that are interested in the use of cold exposurefor increasing testosterone. And some of those people in communities are indeed using cold exposure directly on the gonads, on the testees in order to do this. I'm not certain that that direct contact is necessary. And in some cases it might actually be quite dangerous or you at least should be careful in terms of tissues thereand avoiding damage. But nonetheless, I think that a dopamine impacton testosterone is very likely given the 250% increases in dopamine that have been observed with cold water immersion and all of that points to the fact that cold water immersionvery likely increases testosterone, but as a downstream consequence of the cold water immersion effects on dopamineand luteinizing hormone, and again there's no reason to think that the increases in luteinizing hormone would also increase estrogen. Probably not to dangerous or levels that one would want to avoid, but I don't think that there's anything particularly specific about cold for inducing testosterone and not other hormones. I think it's very likely to increases a number of different hormones. I do hope that there will be a systematic study on thisin the not too distant future. I also hope to not be a subject in the cooling of the gonads experiment.",4385.0,874.0,"1)The practice of using deliberate cold exposure to the groin area, particularly the testicles, to increase testosterone levels exists within various online and fitness communities. Some even market ice pack underwear for this purpose.

2) While there aren't any specific well-controlled studies that show this method to be effective, anecdotal evidence suggests that some people have experienced increases in testosterone levels after practicing this method.

3)Two possible mechanisms might explain how this could work:
a) Cooling a body surface results in vasoconstriction, which is followed by an increased blood flow to the area after the cold is removed. This could possibly enhance organ health, including testosterone production.
b)Exposure to cold could also increase levels of dopamine, a neurotransmitter known to stimulate the production of luteinizing hormone, which in turn can trigger increases in testosterone levels.
4) Direct contact with the cold might not be necessary, and caution should be exercised to avoid damage to the testicles.
5)The effect of cold exposure on hormone levels isn't exclusive to testosterone; it's likely to increase a number of different hormones.",Does cold exposure to the groin area only affect testosterone levels?,Cold Exposure,Andrew Huberman and Susanna Søberg,50,1685321834
Tool: Optimal Timing for Daily Cold Exposure:,"Now I promise you the last topic was the last topic, but there's one other really important point that I think everyone should be aware ofif you're going to use deliberate cold exposure. And that brings us back to the very first thingthat we discussed today, along the lines of deliberate cold exposure, which is that your baseline temperatureis going to be lowest about two hours before you wake up, it's going to increase in the morningand as you wake up and increase throughout the day and afternoon, and then start to drop in the evening and come down at nightas you head to sleep. I also want you to remember that if you are to coolthe external portion of your body, in particular your torso, the net effect of that is going to be an increasein body temperature. So for many people, not all, but for many people, if you are going to do deliberate cold exposure, you are going to increase your core body temperatureand that makes sense if you think about how deliberate cold exposure can increase metabolism by increasing thermogenesis. What that all means is that if you are doing your deliberate cold exposure early in the day, you are going to get yet a further increase in core body temperature that would be associated with wakefulness, your ability to be alert that morning or throughout the day and so on. It also means that if you do your deliberate cold exposurevery late in the evening, or at night, so 6:00 PM, 7:00 PM, 9:00 PM and so on, you are going to increase your core body temperature and if you recall, a decrease in core body temperatureof one to three degrees is not just beneficial, but is necessary in order to get into deep sleepand remain in deep sleep. So the takeaway from this is deliberate cold exposuredone properly will increase your core body temperature and make you feel more alert. So if you're doing it early in the day, that's probably terrific given that most of us want to be alert during the day. However, if you do it too late in the day, evening or night, it can disrupt sleep by way of disrupting your core body temperature. Now, the caveat to that is I myselftend to do deliberate cold exposure early in the day. Maybe not first thing in the morning, but mid morning, maybe as late as three or four in the afternoon in some cases. In the longer days of summer, I might do it even later, five or 6:00 PM and have no trouble sleeping. I have done deliberate cold exposure very late at night, 10:00 PM, 11:00 PM and so on as part of a 30 day challenge of doing deliberate cold exposure every day for 30 daysand I got sloppy with my timing and then in order to not miss a day, I would do it at 11 o'clock at night. And I must say I found that I could still fall asleep very easily, even doing deliberate cold exposure very late at night. However, on those particular days, I was particularly busy and so I was particularly exhausted when I arrived at the deliberate cold exposure and I had no trouble falling asleep after doing deliberate cold exposure, and then taking a nice warm shower and then going to sleep. But I could imagine that because of the increases in core body temperature caused by deliberate cold exposure, that were one to do that too late in the day, evening or night that it could indeed disrupt your sleep. So my recommendation would be for most people only do deliberate cold exposure if you are prepared to be fairly alert for the next one to four or maybe had been six hours following that deliberate cold exposure. So for today's episode,",1316.0,266.0,"the main takeaway is that deliberate cold exposure can increase your core body temperature, which can be beneficial for alertness if done early in the day. However, if done too late in the day, it can disrupt sleep by disrupting your core body temperature. It's recommended to only do deliberate cold exposure if you're prepared to be alert for the next few hours following the exposure.","What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of deliberate cold exposure according to Andrew Huberman and Susanna Søberg, and when is the best time to do it?",Cold Exposure,Andrew Huberman and Susanna Søberg,20,1685321928

In this paper, we challenge the traditional understanding of organizational routines as creating inertia in organizations. We adapt Latour's distinction between ostensive and performative to build a theory that explains why routines are a source of change as well as stability. The ostensive aspect of a routine embodies what we typically think of as the structure. The performative aspect embodies the specific actions, by specific people, at specific times and places, that bring the routine to life. ",1272.0,318.0,,How do Feldman and Pentland (2003) reconceptualize organizational routines as a source of flexibility and change?,Process Improvement within the IT Space,,0,1683866643
,"We argue that the ostensive aspect enables people to guide, account for, and refer to specific performances of a routine, and the performative aspect creates, maintains, and modifies the ostensive aspect of the routine. We argue that the relationship between ostensive and performative aspects of routines creates an on-going opportunity for variation, selection, and retention of new practices and patterns of action within routines and allows routines to generate a wide range of outcomes, from apparent stability to considerable change. This revised ontology of organizational routines provides a better explanation of empirical findings than existing theories of routines and has implications for a wide range of organizational theories.0 Organizational routines are a central feature of human organizations and an explanatory mechanism in many of our most widely accepted theories. Since the concept was introduced by Stene (1940), organizational routines have been regarded as the primary means by which organizations accomplish much of what they do (March and Simon, 1958; Cyert and March, 1963; Thompson, 1967; Nelson and Winter, 1982). While recognized as an essential aspect of organized work, organizational routines are also a well-known source of inertia (Hannan and Freeman, 1983), inflexibility (Weiss and Ilgen, 1985; Gersick and Hackman, 1990), and even mindlessness (Ashforth and Fried, 1988). ",1412.0,353.0,,How do Feldman and Pentland's (2003) perspectives explain the relationship between ostensive and performative aspects of routines?,Process Improvement within the IT Space,,0,1683866648
,"This understanding of organizational routines has deep roots in social theory, as reflected in writings on bureaucracy (Merton, 1940; Weber, 1947; Selznick, 1949; Gouldner, 1954; Blau, 1955). Stability, or ""regularity and continuity,"" is a defining feature of bureaucracies (Stinchcombe, 1959: 184). Organizational rules and routines have been seen as an important source of accountability and political protection as well as a source of stagnation (Weber, 1947; Crozier, 1964; Kaufman, 1977; Hummel, 1987). For better or worse, routines enable bureaucracies to organize expertise and exercise power efficiently. While routines can be a source of inertia and inflexibility, they can also be an important source of flexibility and change. We are not simply referring to meta-routines, routines for changing routines (Adler, Goldoftas, and Levine, 1999). Many organizations employ meta-routines, such as continuous improvement and total quality management (Hackman and Wageman, 1995), as a means to generate change. Metaroutines have been theorized as a mechanism for generating ""dynamic capabilities"" (Teece and Pisano, 1994; Tranfield and Smith, 1998). We refer here to something more basic: the inherent capability of every organizational routine to generate change, merely by its ongoing performance.

Cyert and March (1963) referred to this as adaptation; Nelson and Winter (1982) called it mutation. Change in organizational routines is especially evident when there is a crisis (Gersick and Hackman, 1990), in the early stages of establishing an organization (Naduzzo, Rocco, and Warglien, 2000), or in areas of ambiguity (Miner, 1990). But routines also change in old, established organizations in stable environments (Feldman, 2000). This has led some authors to suggest that, contrary to the received wisdom, routines can be sources of both organizational flexibility (Pentland and Rueter, 1994) and organizational change (Miner, 1990; Feldman, 2000). To explain these observations, a new understanding of organizational routines is needed. The problem is not that existing definitions are erroneous or inadequate. There is considerable agreement in the literature that organizational routines can be defined as repetitive, recognizable patterns of interdependent actions, carried out by multiple actors. ",1259.0,314.0,,How do Feldman and Pentland (2003) view organizational routines as sources of organizational flexibility and change?,Process Improvement within the IT Space,,0,1683866651
,"We accept this definition, but if we analyze it seriously, in light of recent empirical studies and current social theory, it leads us to a new ontology of the underlying phenomenon. This ontology builds on the idea that routines, like other social phenomena, embody a duality of structure and agency (Giddens, 1984; Bourdieu, 1977, 1990). An organizational routine consists of two related parts. One part embodies the abstract idea of the routine (structure), while the other part consists of the actual performances of the routine by specific people, at specific times, in specific places (agency). Each part is necessary, but neither part alone is sufficient to explain (or even describe) the properties of the phenomenon we refer to as ""organizational routines."" Understanding the interactions between these two aspects is necessary for us to appreciate the potential of organizational routines as a source of change. In contrast to traditional views of routines, which emphasize structure, our framework brings agency, and therefore, subjectivity and power back into the picture. Agency involves the ability to remember the past, imagine the future, and respond to present circumstances (Emirbayers and Mische, 1998). ",1223.0,305.0,,How does Feldman and Pentland's (2003) ontology of routines bring agency and power into the picture?,Process Improvement within the IT Space,,0,1683866652
,"While organizational routines are commonly perceived as reenacting the past, the performance of routines can also involve adapting to contexts that require either idiosyncratic or ongoing changes and reflecting on the meaning of actions for future realities. While organizational routines are commonly portrayed as promoting cognitive efficiency, they also entail self-reflective and other-reflective behavior. We argue that organizational routines consist of the resulting performances and the understandings of these performances. As a result of the movement among these aspects, organizational routines are inherently capable of endogenous change. They can still be defined as repetitive, recognizable patterns of interdependent actions, but they cannot be understood as static, unchanging objects. To clarify our discussion of the complex phenomenon represented by organizational routines, we refer throughout to one example of such a routine that is familiar to most of us, the academic ""hiring"" routine. 95/ASQ, March 2003 This content downloaded from 130.92.9.56 on Mon, 8 Jul 2013 05:51:21 AMAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and ConditionsORGANIZATIONAL ROUTINES: A COMPLEX PHENOMENON It is tempting to think that organizational routines are clearly understood because the term is so widely used.

,"This is not the case. While organizational routines are everywhere around us, they have been remarkably difficult to conceptualize in a rigorous way (Cohen et al., 1996; Cohen and Bacdayan, 1994; Reynaud, 1998). Typical dictionary definitions emphasize specific, fixed sequences: ""A prescribed, detailed course of action to be followed regularly; a standard procedure"" (The American Heritage? Dictionary of the English Language, 4th ed., 2000). To capture the distinctively organizational dimension of the phenomenon, organizational scholars have emphasized the involvement of multiple individuals and the interdependence of their actions (e.g., March and Simon, 1958; Cyert and March, 1963; Cohen and Bacdayan, 1994; Cohen et al., 1996; Feldman and Rafaeli, 2002). Based on our reading of this literature, we have distilled what we call a core definition: an organizational routine is a repetitive, recognizable pattern of interdependent actions, involving multiple actors.

,"To help clarify the nature of organizational routines and provide a common point of reference for our argument, we use the example of the academic hiring routine. Hiring is one of the examples commonly used by authors who discuss organizational routines (March and Simon, 1958; Cyert and March, 1963; Nelson and Winter, 1982). It is a classic organizational routine, meeting all aspects of the core definition. It is repetitive. It involves an easily recognized pattern of actions that includes attracting candidates to apply, screening applicants, choosing applicants, and, if a positive decision is made, extending an offer. These actions are interdependent, in the sense that the output of one action (e.g., screening) is the input to another (e.g., choosing) (Thompson, 1967). And in most organizations, hiring is carried out by multiple actors; it is an organizational routine, not an individual routine. We focus on the hiring routine in academic institutions because of its familiarity to our readers and because the basic issues are similar in any work organization. Theorizing Organizational Routines: The Traditional Story The nature of organizational routines. The definition of organizational routines provides a set of criteria for identifying when something is or is not an organizational routine, but it does not provide a theory or explanation of why these recognizable patterns of action are so prevalent or what effects they have (Sutton and Staw, 1995).

,"Given their importance, many scholars before us have theorized about the nature of organizational routines. Three dominant metaphors of organizational routines can be drawn from this extensive and diverse literature. Together, they create a relatively coherent story about the nature of organizational routines, their causes, and their consequences (Abbott, 1992). These metaphors 96/ASQ, March 2003 This content downloaded from 130.92.9.56 on Mon, 8 Jul 2013 05:51:21 AMAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and ConditionsOrganizational Routines form the basis for theorizing about why we have routines and what the effects of routines are. Each of these metaphors, however, tends to reinforce our understanding of routines as unitary and unchanging. First, organizational routines have been compared to individual habits (Stene, 1940; Simon, 1945: 88-89; Nelson and Winter, 1982: 73). From this perspective, the organization is likened to an individual, and the people in the organization become its arms and legs. Habits require no thought; they are automatic. Second, organizational routines have been likened to programs, performance programs, heuristics, or scripts (March and Simon, 1958; Cyert and March, 1963; Allison, 1971; Gioia and Poole, 1984; Carley, 1996; Carley and Lin, 1997; Levitt et al., 1999).

,"Standard operating procedures are the archetypal example of a performance program. Programs may require more processing than habits because they may involve choices, branches, or decision points. As conceptualized by March and Simon (1958: 142), however, they do not require any deliberate search, as all of the major decisions are made in advance. The third metaphor of organizational routines originates in the work of Nelson and Winter (1982), who likened organizational routines to genetic material. In evolutionary theory, these routines play the role that genes play in biological evolutionary theory: ""They are a persistent feature of the organism and determine its possible behavior (though actual behavior is determined also by the environment) . . ."" (Nelson and Winter, 1982: 14). In ecological theory, routines store genealogical information that is passed unchanged from organization to organization (Baum and Singh, 1994: 3-4). In all three metaphors (programs, habits, and genes), we have an image of routines as relatively fixed, unchanging objects. These metaphors treat organizational routines as mechanisms or abstractions, rather than as collective human activities. As with any abstraction, the focus is on the central tendencies rather than variation.

,"As a result, these metaphors highlight the inertial qualities of routines and tend to minimize the possibility of flexibility and change. The origin of organizational routines. The organizational literature explains the prevalence of organizational routines by the need for cognitive efficiency and the reduction of complexity (March and Simon, 1958; Simon, 1981; Cohen and Bacdayan, 1994; Cohen et al., 1996). Organizational routines may also reflect a response to some managerial goal or environmental pressure (Cohen et al., 1996) and can be seen as one product of organizational learning (Argote, 1999). Organizational learning promotes reduced variability, standardization, and the avoidance of failure (March, 1991: 83). Some have also argued that routines foster the perceived legitimacy of organizations as institutions (Meyer and Rowan, 1977; Feldman and March, 1981) because their behavior conforms to established norms. These explanations suggest that routines arise because they are functional; they minimize cost and increase managerial control, while maximizing the legitimacy of the organization. This provides a theoretical explanation for why organizations do not want to reinvent and renegotiate the hiring procedure each time, for example.

Routines have also been analyzed from the perspective of conflict and power. For example, Nelson and Winter's (1982) analogy of ""routines as truce"" suggested that routines are a means to avoid procedural warfare. Organizational participants may agree to disagree and move on in order to get the work done. The routine, as an agreement about how to do the work, reduces conflict. Routinization can also be seen as a means to impose managerial control over the labor force (Braverman, 1974). In this view, conflict is not necessarily reduced but is suppressed. Organizational routines are also theorized to be a natural product of action that occurs in the context of the enabling and constraining structures that are typical of modern organizations (Barley, 1986; Feldman, 1989; Pentland and Rueter, 1994; Orlikowski, 2000). The organizational context makes some actions easier, and therefore more likely, and other actions harder, and therefore less likely.

,"Repetitive patterns of action will tend to emerge as organizational members choose to take the easier actions and avoid the harder ones. On a psychological level, Giddens (1984) has suggested that the routinization of daily life helps to foster a sense of ontological security. Novelty can lead to anxiety and loss of security. Unlike the functionalist explanations of cognitive efficiency and legitimation, these structuration explanations do not imply that the patterns of action we observe are necessarily efficient or legitimate. They are just patterns. The structuration perspective also suggests that by performing these patterns of action, members tend to reinforce and reproduce the underlying structures. The effects of organizational routines. Generally speaking, routines are conceptualized as sources of stability. With some exceptions (Adler, Goldoftas, and Levine, 1999; Feldman, 2000), prevailing theories suggest that routines lead to inertia (Hannan and Freeman, 1983), mindlessness (Ashforth and Fried, 1988), deskilling (Leidner, 1993), demotivation (Ilgen and Hollenbeck, 1991), and competency traps (March, 1991). By analogy to individual habit, routines are seen as the antithesis of flexibility and change, locking organizations into inflexible, unchanging patterns of action.

,"At the same time, functionalist theories emphasize their potential for efficiency and legitimacy. Because routines encode organizational capabilities and knowledge, they are seen as a key component of organizational learning (Levitt and March, 1988; March, 1991; Argote, 1999). In this theoretical tradition, routines play the role of memory (Huber, 1991). They are conceptualized as a way to store knowledge and capabilities. In this view, changes in routines are often the result of external pressures (e.g., often from management) to improve performance. Thus, while routines are implicated as an important part of organizational learning, it is their structural and, therefore, more stable aspect that is emphasized. 98/ASQ, March 2003 This content downloaded from 130.92.9.56 on Mon, 8 Jul 2013 05:51:21 AMAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and ConditionsOrganizational Routines The emphasis on the stability or rigidity of organizational routines has provided evolutionary theorists with an ideal mechanism for the retention of genealogical information (Baum and Singh, 1994; Aldrich, 1999).

,"."" The logic of evolutionary theory depends on the existence of some genealogical mechanism, and the supposed stability of organizational routines seems to fill this need. Some Problems with Prevailing Theory The existing literature on routines is quite diverse, yet it embodies a fairly consistent way of theorizing about routines. To maximize efficiency and legitimacy and minimize or suppress conflict, organizations use routines to achieve their work processes. The resulting organizational routines are like habits or programs that are executed without conscious thought. Like DNA, routines are the genetic material from which organizations are reproduced. Because of their nature as fixed structures, the story goes, routines also result in inertia, inflexibility, and mindlessness. This way of understanding organizational routines provides a convincing explanation of stability in organizations. It leaves some things out, however, and in so doing it seriously hampers our ability to understand the dynamics of organizational routines and how they relate to organizational stability and change. What has been omitted are considerations of agency-people perform the routines-and observational data that evidence flexibility and change, rather than stability and inertia.

,"Lack of agency. Conceptualizing organizational routines as habits, programs, or genes severely limits the role of human agency. Emirbayers and Mische (1998: 975) used the term ""iteration"" to describe phenomena, including organizational routines, noting that such phenomena are ""difficult to conceive of in properly agentic terms."" They went on to argue that ""the agentic dimension lies in how actors selectively recognize, locate and implement such schemas [habits, routines] in their ongoing and situated transactions"" (p. 976). This would suggest that organizational routines do involve agency, but that possibility is minimized or excluded from our traditional theories. The omission of agency may be unavoidable because, ironically, there are no people in these traditional metaphors. For example, the metaphor of individual habit amalgamates all participants in a routine into a single anthropomorphized organization. The differences in information, perception, preferences, and interpretation among people who perform these routines fade into the background and become peripheral to the understanding of organizational routines. The emphasis in the performance program analogy is on cognitive efficiency and the reduction of search and choice.

Agency is associated with the person who writes the program but not with those who execute it. Similarly, in the genetic metaphor, the effectiveness of routines as carriers of genealogical information depends on their stability. This metaphor excludes the possibility of agency or choice. The traditional explanation of organizational routines as a source of cognitive efficiency tends to reinforce the absence of agency within the routine itself. To the extent that decisions are necessary for the creation of organizational routines, those decisions are portrayed as outside the routine. Thus, routines are sometimes characterized as decisions that were made in the past that do not have to be reconsidered unless circumstances change (Weiss and Ilgen, 1985; Ashforth and Fried, 1988; Egidi, in Cohen et al., 1996: 695). Routines have sometimes been characterized as decisions that have been made in the past that are not reconsidered even when circumstances do change (e.g., Morison, 1966: 10-11; Wilensky, 1967: 24-32).

,"Contradictory data. Another problem is that the premise of the traditional story is contradicted by observational data. Organizational routines are certainly repetitive, but they are not necessarily fixed or unchanging. Many scholars have provided empirical evidence of both change and variability in organizational routines (e.g., Suchman, 1983; Miner, 1990; Pentland and Rueter, 1994; Feldman, 2000; Naduzzo, Rocco, and Warglien, 2000; Edmondson, Bohmer, and Pisano, 2001; Pentland, 2003). Existing theories do not entirely rule out the possibility of variability or change, but neither do they help explain it. At the very least, we need a way of conceptualizing organizational routines that enables us to accommodate these observations. A NEW THEORY OF ORGANIZATIONAL ROUTINES Our goal here is to create a new theory of organizational routines that retains the valuable insights of prior work while enabling us to account for the empirical observations that expose the limitations of this work. Beyond that, we strive for a conceptualization that enables us to see how stability and change in organizational routines are related. We offer a new ontology of organizational routines that adopts a perspective based on new understandings of the relation between structure and action (Bourdieu, 1977, 1990; Giddens, 1984; Ortner, 1989) and accounts for empirical findings about routines.

We propose that organizational routines also consist of ostensive and performative aspects, which are closely related to the concepts of structure and agency, as found in structuration theory (Giddens, 1984). We adopt specialized terminology because, in the domain of organizational routines, structure and agency are mediated by the repetitive collective, interdependent nature of the phenomenon. 100/ASQ, March 2003 This content downloaded from 130.92.9.56 on Mon, 8 Jul 2013 05:51:21 AMAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and ConditionsOrganizational Routines Organizational Routines as Dualities Organizational routines consist of two aspects: the ostensive and the performative. The ostensive aspect is the ideal or schematic form of a routine. It is the abstract, generalized idea of the routine, or the routine in principle. The performative aspect of the routine consists of specific actions, by specific people, in specific places and times. It is the routine in practice.

,"Both of these aspects are necessary for an organizational routine to exist. The ostensive aspect. The ostensive aspect of a routine shapes our perception of what the routine is. A common version of the ostensive aspect of the hiring routine involves attracting, screening, and choosing applicants. If applicants are chosen, the routine would also include some form of extending an offer and joining up. This ostensive aspect may be codified as a standard operating procedure, or it may exist as a taken-for-granted norm. The ostensive aspect may have a significant tacit component embedded in procedural knowledge (Cohen and Bacdayan, 1994). Artifacts of this aspect may exist in various forms. In the case of hiring routines, for instance, there may be written hiring procedures, application forms, or copies of past employment ads. It is tempting to conceptualize the ostensive aspect of the routine as a single, unified object, like a standard operating procedure. This would be a mistake, because the ostensive incorporates the subjective understandings of diverse participants. Like any socially distributed stock of knowledge, the ostensive aspect of a routine is usually not monolithic; it is likely to be distributed unevenly (Berger and Luckmann, 1966; Schutz, 1967).

The dean's perspective on the academic hiring routine is likely to be quite different from a graduate student's perspective. The ostensive aspect of the routine gains in apparent objectivity and concreteness as the views of different participants come into alignment. But it is still only a partial picture because it does not include the performances. The ostensive aspect of the routine cannot encompass specific performances because it is impossible to specify any routine in sufficient detail that it could actually be carried out. As Blau (1955: 23) noted, the rules of what he called a bureaucratic procedure ""must be abstract in order to guide the different courses of action necessary for the accomplishment of an objective in diverse situations."" There are always contextual details that remain open-and that must remain open-for the routine to be carried out. Rules are resources for action, but they do not fully determine action (Zimmerman, 1970; Giddens, 1984; Taylor, 1993). As Wittgenstein (1958) argued, no amount of rules is sufficient to specify a pattern of behavior fully, because the interpretation of any rule, or any part of a rule, requires more rules.

Pentland and Rueter (1994) used the phrase ""effortful accomplishments"" to describe the way in which participants construct routines from a repertoire of possibilities. In his theory of practice, Bourdieu (1977, 1990) argued that practice is inherently improvisational. Practices are carried out against a background of rules and expectations, but the particular courses of action we choose are always, to some extent, novel. Unreflective, habitual action is certainly possible, but even in highly constrained situations, participants engage in reflective self-monitoring in order to see what they are doing (Giddens, 1984). In work settings with detailed descriptions of the expected sequence of steps in a procedure, for instance, participants introduce variations (Roy, 1959; Victor, Boynton, and Stephens-Jahng, 2000; Narduzzo, Rocco, and Warglien, 2000).

,"They interpret their actions in order to make sense of what they are doing and, though their choices of how to proceed appear automatic or mindless at times, there is always the possibility of resisting expectations and doing otherwise (Giddens, 1984; Orlikowski, 2000). For these reasons, the performative aspect of routines can best be understood as inherently improvisational. Even routines that have been engaged in by the same people many times need to be adjusted to changing contexts. The work of Hutchins (1991), Orlikowski (2000), Suchman (1983), and Weick and Roberts (1993) illustrates the improvisatory nature of performing organizational routines. As with musical improvisation, the degree of divergence from the score may vary considerably, from minor adjustments to cadence and dynamics to near total re-invention (Weick, 1998). And just as musical improvisation involves listening to what others are playing, improvisation in organizational routines involves attending to the actions taken by relevant others and the details of the situation (Moorman and Miner, 1998a, 1998b; Feldman and Rafaeli, 2002). The performance of an academic hiring routine, for instance, is situated in a complex context and must be sensitive to features of this context.

,"To begin with, specific arrangements have to be made to accommodate particular positions, particular search committees, and particular candidates. For example, an academic hiring routine might need to be adapted for a joint appointment between two departments. The specific arrangements made have implications for the future, as they set precedents and establish expectations for what actions can be taken in future hiring situations. For all the reasons discussed earlier, performances of the hiring routine generate a constant stream of variations and exceptions as the performers accommodate and innovate. Routines as a Combination of Ostensive and Performative Aspects The ostensive aspect of the routine is the idea; the performative aspect, the enactment. Both aspects are necessary to constitute what we understand to be the routine. The concepts of ostensive and performative have many analogies. In terms of music, the ostensive part is like the musical score, while the performative part is the actual performance of the 102/ASO, March 2003 This content downloaded from 130.92.9.56 on Mon, 8 Jul 2013 05:51:21 AMAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and ConditionsOrganizational Routines music.

,"Without making this distinction, the parts--either the ostensive or the performative-can be mistaken for the whole. The most common mistake is to take the ostensive for the performative, or to mistake the summary of the way tasks are performed for the ways tasks are actually performed. Changing one does not necessarily lead to a change in the other. Overestimating the importance of the ostensive leads managers to underestimate the importance of the adjustments and improvisations that people undertake to make the routine work. Moreover, unless we distinguish between these aspects of routines, we cannot explore the relationship between them. Understanding this relationship is important, as it can help us understand the role of variation in organizational routines and the interplay between variability and stability. Ultimately, this helps us understand more about change in organizations. Same Definition, New Understanding Since our goal is to build on existing insights from the literature, it is important to note that the ostensive/performative ontology is consistent with the definition of organizational routines articulated earlier: repetition, a recognizable pattern of action, multiple participants, and interdependent actions.

,"Indeed, the consensus definition strongly suggests the need for the new ontology, irrespective of any other considerations. We illustrate this by analyzing the academic hiring routine in terms of the definition. Repetition. In every organization with employees, hiring occurs more than once. It is repeated over time. Of course, hiring occurs differently for different kinds of positions: hiring a new dean is different from hiring an assistant professor, which is different from hiring an adjunct professor. And within each kind of position, each search is a little different. Thus, even within a single organization, we must conceptualize hiring as a category with many instances. In terms of our framework, we refer to these instances as performances. Recognizable pattern of action. While the instances of hiring may differ, they bear a sufficient family resemblance to cohere as a recognizable category (Wittgenstein, 1958). In fact, the hiring routine has a core pattern of actions that is repeated in virtually all instances of hiring. This pattern involves determining one's needs, writing a position description, advertising the position, receiving and reviewing applications, interviewing applicants, ranking applicants, offering the position to an applicant, and negotiating terms.

Thus, organizational routines are not just individual routines that are performed in the context of an organization. The involvement of multiple participants ensures that the ostensive aspect of a routine-its structural aspect-cannot be monolithic or undifferentiated, except perhaps in trivial cases.

The involvement of multiple individuals inevitably introduces diversity in the information, interpretive schemes, and goals of the participants. The individuals performing the routine do not all have access to the same information, and even if they did, they might not interpret the information in the same way. Everyone who engages in a pattern of activity is not necessarily seeking the same result (Feldman, 1989). As a result of these factors, their subjective interpretations of the appropriate course of action will differ. This is what Sewell (1992) referred to as the multiplicity of structure. There is no single, objective routine, but a variety of different perspectives on what is involved. That people perform organizational routines across time and space adds to the opportunities for different understandings of the actions people have taken as well as the appropriate next action. People may be unaware of others' actions because they see only the artifacts of these actions. They do not see the process of creating an ad for a position; they see only the ad (Rafaeli and Oliver, 1998).

While some people, for instance, will understand the affirmative action statement included in the ad as a call to alter the way recruiting, screening, and choosing are conducted, others will not. Interdependent actions. Individuals act, but they do so in a context created by the actions of the other participants. Because their actions are interdependent, each performance of a routine is a collective performance. Like dancers, participants in an organizational routine must adjust to each other's actions (Feldman and Rafaeli, 2002). Interdependence is not limited to the immediate actions of the participants. The parts of any routine are enmeshed in far-reaching, complex, tangled webs of interdependence. Nothing happens in a vacuum. As Blau (1955: 35) noted, ""the focus on specific procedures with single objectives grossly oversimplifies the complexities of organizational life.""

A key step in the hiring process may be getting a spousal appointment or a green card or changes in a child custody agreement. When a search fails, as many searches do, external factors are frequently the cause.

While interdependence between actions can be viewed as part of structure (Pentland, 1995), it can also generate variety within specific performances. The phenomenon we refer to as ""hiring"" clearly meets the basic definition of an organizational routine: it is a repetitive, recognizable pattern of interdependent actions carried out by multiple actors. The involvement of multiple actors introduces the diversity of goals, information, and interpretations, while the interdependence of actions blurs and opens the boundaries of the routine to outside influence. While organizational routines are clearly repetitive, these defining features ensure that they cannot simply be repeated. Thus, the definition leads us to something of a paradox. On one hand, the ""hiring routine"" has endless variation: every performance is different. On the other hand, ""the hiring routine"" has a clear and simple gloss: it is easily recognized and summarized. The approach that we propose recognizes that this duality is an essential part of every organizational routine.

,"Relation of Ostensive and Performative Aspects New social theories, such as structuration and practice theories, have emphasized the relationship rather than the differences between dualistic qualities. Structuration theory, for example, proposes that structure is produced and reproduced through the actions taken by agents, and the actions taken are constrained and enabled by structure (Giddens, 1984). Adopting a structuration or practice theory perspective leads us to view the ostensive and performative aspects of organizational routines as recursively related, with the performances creating and recreating the ostensive aspect and the ostensive aspect constraining and enabling the performances. Ostensive to Performative People can use the ostensive aspect of routines prospectively, as a guide to what actions ought to be taken, or retrospec105/ASQ, March 2003 This content downloaded from 130.92.9.56 on Mon, 8 Jul 2013 05:51:21 AMAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditionstively, as a guide to accounting for actions already taken.

,"Guiding, accounting, and referring enable us to exert power over our own and other people's performances through the ability both to signify that some performances are part of a recognizable routine and to legitimate some performances as appropriate to that routine. Guiding. The ostensive aspect of a routine can serve as a template for behavior or a normative goal. This is what Nelson and Winter (1982) called the ""routine as target"" and why routines are sometimes likened to scripts. But it serves only as a guide; it cannot specify the details of the performance, which people must always choose. This irreducible element of agency requires reflexive self-monitoring (Giddens, 1984), in the sense that we may use the ostensive aspect of routines to check up on ourselves (or others) as we go about our activities. The ""hiring"" routine has a powerful effect on behavior for both the people doing the hiring and the people wanting to be hired, as evidenced by the difference between the trips that academics make to universities for hiring purposes and for the purpose of presenting research. In many respects, they are similar. For both, someone from the university invites a scholar who comes to the university, usually for a day or two.

But there are also differences that are important to the execution of the routine. Different questions may be asked and answered. More or less attention may be paid to making the visitor feel comfortable and welcome. Accounting. The ostensive aspect of routines allows us to explain what we are doing and provides a sense of when it is appropriate to ask for an accounting (Lyman and Scott, 1968; Orbuch, 1997). Connecting one's behavior to a particular routine legitimates the behavior if it is understood to be part of the routine and de-legitimates it if it is not. This is basically a retrospective sensemaking function (Weick, 1995). It helps us decide what aspects of our performances we should report or conceal and, in doing so, what we should say about them. For example, when filling out working papers, financial auditors ""routinize"" their accounts to conform to various standards and increase their apparent legitimacy; the police do the same thing with arrest reports by selectively including and excluding appropriate details (Van Maanen and Pentland, 1994).

And because it is prohibited, it takes on additional significance: inquiring about a spouse's employment in the context of a job search is often a sign of taking a candidate very seriously. Otherwise, why risk breaking the rules? More generally, rules are not always followed: they can be strategically flaunted in order to convey a particular meaning (Garfinkel, 1967; Heritage, 1984).

People use the ostensive aspect of routines to refer to patterns of activity that would otherwise be incomprehensible. When we use the term ""hiring,"" it stands for an unknowable and unpredictable set of actions. The ostensive aspect of the routine allows us to refer to and make sense of a sea of activities that could otherwise be overwhelming. In using it, we create a gloss that summarizes and omits, a story that privileges some activities over others. We must take action in the midst of the ""booming, buzzing confusion"" that surrounds us (James, 1890), and labeling the activity helps us pay attention to a comprehensible and manageable portion of it. Referring is essential to complex organizations (Arrow, 1974) because it allows organizational members to engage in activities that we do not fully understand. We can invoke the ""hiring"" routine without being aware of all the details of how it will be accomplished and what, exactly, engaging in it will entail for us.

,"Performative to Ostensive The performative aspect of routines is essential for the creation, maintenance, and modification of the ostensive aspect in much the same way that speaking creates, maintains, and alters a language. Performances enact the ostensive aspect of the routine, although this is largely an unintended effect of action (Giddens, 1984). The intent and motivation of people performing a hiring routine is not to create, maintain, or modify the ostensive aspect of the routine but to try to hire someone. Nonetheless, an important outcome of engaging in actions is their effect on the structures that constrain and enable further action, and three closely related effects are the creation, maintenance, and modification of organizational routines. Creation. Organizational routines are repetitive. A pattern of actions that occurs only once is not a routine. Furthermore, even if a pattern of actions repeats, it needs to become recognizable as a pattern. In other words, a disconnected collection of performances does not constitute a routine without a corresponding ostensive category that makes the patterns coherent and recognizable as a routine.

,"Through repetition and recognition, organizational routines are created. To return to our example, it is hard to imagine a hiring routine not existing. We can, however, imagine significant parts of hiring routines that come into being, for instance, the commitment to search for underrepresented minorities. While we are required by law to state the commitment, if the statement is not followed by action, then the commitment is not part of the hiring routine. When substantive actions are taken (e.g., seeking out underrepresented minority candidates), the words come to life and become meaningful. Otherwise, only the ""lip service"" itself could be considered part of the routine. Maintenance. Performing an organizational routine maintains the ostensive aspect of the routine by exercising the capability to enact it. In this sense, the ostensive aspect is like the script of a play or like a musical score. Over time, if no one chooses to read the script or play the music, the capability to do so vanishes. It is as if the air goes out of the balloon and it just collapses. It may take many years for the idea of a routine to dissipate completely, however, even if it is never performed. This may be particularly true when it is committed to paper or encoded into some kind of artifact, such as a script or a formal procedure.

These documents, like recipes from a medieval kitchen, are artifacts of routines that are no longer performed. Performing a hiring routine maintains, and in fact develops, many of the capabilities required to perform it. Interviewing, for instance, is a skill that people often become better at as they practice it and as they attend to how others practice it and that may dissipate with lack of use. In an academic context, hiring routines often involve the ability to make a convincing case to one's colleagues about the importance of a particular type of scholarly work and the advisability of interviewing and extending an offer to a particular scholar. The understandings required to make an argument convincing are maintained, in part, by engaging in hiring routines and other related routines (such as promotion routines) and trying out or being an audience to arguments that are either accepted or rejected.

Subjectivity, Agency, and Power In contrast to the traditional story, which suggests that organizational routines are simply followed or reproduced, our theory points to the central importance of subjectivity, agency, and power as influences on the flexibility of and change in routines. Subjectivity. Our theory suggests that routines are both objective and subjective and that the two are integrally related. In spite of the endless variation in organizational routines that we have described, organizational members would generally have no trouble describing the hiring routine in their organization to an outsider. They also would have no trouble using this hiring routine to account for their own behavior or to ask for accounts from others.

,"For practical purposes, everyone understands the routine. When members of an organization refer to ""hiring"" or ""budgeting,"" these patterns acquire a sense of objectivity and concreteness. We signify this objective reality when we use it to name routines and to specify appropriate behaviors. As a collective performance, however, a routine is energized and guided by the subjective perceptions of the participants. The ostensive aspect of a routine enables us to create an apparently objective reality through the subjective acts of guiding, accounting, and referring. As practiced, objective and subjective dimensions are mutually constitutive (Bourdieu, 1990). Objective and subjective aspects are inseparable because the objectified summaries of routines (the artifacts) are constructed from our subjective perceptions of them. Thus, ironically, routines exist as objects because of our subjective understandings of them. In a sense, our subjective understanding and interpretation is the glue that binds the actions into the patterns we recognize as the routine. Agency. Our framework is consistent with current perspectives on agency (Emirbayers and Mische, 1998), which emphasize the active engagement of individuals in on-going practices and the interpenetration of agency with various forms of structure.

The collective and interdependent nature of performance in organizational routines makes it difficult to say exactly which possibilities will really be feasible when the time comes to act. This is because, by definition, individuals engaged in organizational routines do not act alone, or independently. The interdependence of actions can set practical constraints on individuals that are unique to particular performances. In situations in which there is sequential interdependence, the choices of ""downstream"" actors are constrained by the choices of the ""upstream"" actors. For example, if nobody applies for a particular job, then interviewing is not a realistic possibility for that particular performance of the hiring routine.

,"Thus, the effects of individual agency, as conceptualized by Giddens (1984) or Emirbayers and Mische (1998), are mediated by the interdependence of actions, which is a defining characteristic of organizational routines. Nevertheless, these constraints are anything but absolute, and performances within organizational routines display a great deal of variety, as the empirical studies of routines show. In fact, the ability to use agency in the context of a performance that is otherwise highly scripted is a potent way of exerting power. Power. Our theory draws attention to the inevitable importance of power in organizational routines. The creation and enforcement of organizational routines can be viewed as a primary mechanism for the domination of labor by management (Braverman, 1974; Burawoy, 1979). Braverman (1974: 107, emphasis in original) argued that modern management rests on ""the control over work through the control over the decisions that are made in the course of the work."" Thus, variations can be viewed as evidence of resistance (Leidner, 1993). This analysis might suggest that the ostensive aspect of a routine is aligned with managerial interests (dominance), while the performative aspect is aligned with the interests of labor (resistance). ",1269.0,317.0,,How does the interdependence of actions within organizational routines mediate individual agency according to Feldman and Pentland (2003)?,Process Improvement within the IT Space,,0,1683866692
,"The movement from ostensive to performative (guiding, accounting, and referring) can certainly be interpreted in terms of managerial control. For example, managers are usually empowered to create rules and other artifacts that document a particular version of the ostensive aspect. Managers may also have power to monitor performances and enforce compliance. To the extent that individuals internalize the managerial version of the ostensive aspect of the routine, overt monitoring and enforcement may be unnecessary. But power permeates the interaction between the performative and ostensive aspects of organizational routines in other ways, as well. For instance, in the movement from the performative to the ostensive, whereby variations may or may not get incorporated into the recognized routine, what becomes (or does not become) a recognized part of the ostensive aspect of the routine depends on the power of particular individuals or groups to anoint performances as legitimate or appropriate. Individuals or groups with power to identify particular performances as ""routine"" have the'power to turn exceptions into rules and, thus, to enact the organization in ways they think appropriate. 110/ASQ, March 2003 This content downloaded from 130.92.9.56 on Mon, 8 Jul 2013 05:51:21 AMAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and ConditionsOrganizational Routines The performative aspect confers power in other ways that are not adequately expressed by the notion of resistance.

,"Variations are often necessary to manage unexpected contingencies and exceptions (Perrow, 1967); the ability to improvise an effective variation is likely to be a valued skill. Also, to the extent that individuals or groups can generate novel performances, they can influence the future direction of the routine. Performances that are more visible, or more recognizable, may be more influential. Indeed, the performative aspect of routines has been seen as a primary source of power for non-managerial employees (Crozier, 1964). IMPLICATIONS The new understanding of organizational routines that we offer has implications for a variety of topics in organization theory. By providing a vocabulary for describing the parts of organizational routines and their relationship that is consistent with current concepts in social theory, it allows us to move beyond metaphors as a way of understanding organizational routines. This new understanding of routines has methodological implications relevant to anyone studying organizational routines and substantive implications particularly relevant to scholars interested in the role organizational routines play in organizational stability and change.

,"In particular, when scholars study organizational routines, they need to be aware of whether they are studying the performative or ostensive aspects. It is easy to mistake the ostensive part of the routine for the whole routine, since that is where the dominant metaphors direct our attention. Failure to make a clear distinction can have direct consequences for empirical research. For example, in a study of customer service routines at a large bank, Pentland (2003) found that standard survey measures of task variety produced opposite results from measures based on observed sequences of behavior. The most routinized task units based on one measure were the least routinized based on the other measure (and vice versa). Pentland (2003) speculated that these findings may be because the survey measures tap into the idea of the routine-the ostensive aspect-while behavioral observations are indicators of the performative aspect. The difference between ostensive and performative aspects helps to explain these kinds of contradictory findings and adds a level of nuance to what we mean by task variety. Pentland (2003) argued that our traditional measures of task variety (Withey, Daft, and Cooper, 1983) are more indicative of variations in the content of work, not variations in the pattern of actions used to accomplish the work.

Knowing that there are two aspects to this behavior will help students of organizational routines sort out such contradictions when they occur. Endogenous Change in Organizational Routines This framework also opens the possibility for a deeper understanding of when and why stability and change take place. In particular, our theory enables us to see the potential for endogenous change in organizational routines. The potential for endogenous change has implications for fundamental debates about organizational change and the locus of change in organizations.

,"Endogenous change has been observed (e.g., Miner and Estler, 1985; Miner, 1991; Burgelman, 1994; Feldman, 2000), but it has been difficult to explain. Because routines have been treated as fixed, unified entities, change has been conceived of as driven by exogenous forces such as market changes or new technologies (Tushman and Romanelli, 1985; Barley, 1986, 1990; Gersick and Hackman, 1990; Orlikowski, 1992; Edmondson, Bohmer, and Pisano, 2001). In contrast, recognizing the dual nature of organizational routines provides us with a way of conceptualizing change that comes from within organizational routines: change that is a result of engagement in the routine itself. The model of variation and selective retention articulated by Campbell (1965) is useful in explaining change within organizational routines. Variation and selective retention has been applied to understanding change over time in organizational forms (Hannan and Freeman, 1983; Aldrich, 1999) and also change within organizations (Baum and Singh, 1994; Miner and Haunschild, 1995; Aldrich, 1999). Understanding that organizational routines are not unitary entities enables us to use variation and selective retention as a framework to understand change within routines, as well.

This possibility is consistent with Campbell (1994: 23), who noted that in addition to selection at the level of organizational form, ""there are also selection processes at all other organizational levels."" In drawing on the variation and selective retention framework, we are not suggesting that routines are necessarily functionally adaptive. To ensure functional adaptation, variation and selective retention requires an effective, consistent, selection mechanism, which may or may not be present in any given situation (Campbell, 1965, 1994). We use the variation and selective retention framework to make a much narrower claim: that a given routine, within a given organization, has the inherent, endogenous capacity to generate and retain novel patterns of action. Endogenous change in routines is possible because of their agentic quality (Emirbayers and Mische, 1998).

,"This movement between performative and ostensive provides many opportunities for people to produce variations on a routine, to select these variations, and to retain them as what it means to do this particular routine. As we noted earlier, there are many reasons why there will be variation in the performance of any particular task associated with a routine in a specific time and place. The mechanisms of guiding, referring, and accounting enable participants in routines to create variations that other participants recognize as legitimate instances of the ostensive aspect of the routine. Some variations will be intentional, in the sense that the participants want to change the ostensive aspect of the routine in order to alter the way they do their jobs (Feldman, 2000). Variations on the hiring routine that produce more diverse pools of applicants, for instance, are often intentional variations. Other variations will be unintentional (Aldrich, 1999). There may be new interpretations of the ostensive aspect of the routine (e.g., job talks may become a way to screen candidates for suitability as teachers), or there may be accommodations to particular features of the given context (e.g., the videoconference interview).

,"Selection within organizational routines occurs in two ways. First, as discussed above, people will sometimes vary the performances that the ostensive aspect of the routine guides, refers to, and accounts for. We might refer to these intentional variations as ""selective variations"" (Miner, 1994; Aldrich, 1999). Then, from among the variations that are produced both intentionally and unintentionally, people interpret some as the ostensive aspect of the routine. Through this selection of variations, the ostensive aspect of the routine is created, maintained, and modified. We might refer to this as ""selective retention."" Retention within organizational routines occurs when people turn a variation into part of the story about how they do hiring. Videoconferencing may never become the modal process for interviewing, but it may become an option that people choose under various circumstances. Once it is an option, then the various circumstances can increase to include not only inclement weather but also impending births or other short-term health concerns. One can imagine people using the option in a ""pre-interviewing"" process in which applicants who live far away might be screened prior to making a large commitment of time and money to have a face-toface interview.

Thus, simply doing the routine in the various circumstances in which it must be performed can bring about change in the routine. And if consistent, effective selection criteria are in place, variation and selective retention can lead to functional adaptations. The whole idea of continuous improvement could be viewed as a direct application of this basic process. Our theory suggests that many different actors can be sources of variation and selection. Our framework makes clear that enacting the performative and ostensive aspects of 113/ASQ, March 2003 This content downloaded from 130.92.9.56 on Mon, 8 Jul 2013 05:51:21 AMAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditionsroutines is a collective endeavor. Because routines are enacted by many people, there are many actors who influence the process of variation and selection. The role of agency in producing and selecting variation has been noted by Miner (1994) and Miner and Haunschild (1995), who showed that managers exercise agency as they choose both to introduce variations and to select variations produced by others.

,"Implications of Endogenous Change This discussion suggests that the reliance on organizational routines as a genealogical mechanism deserves reconsideration. If the gene is changing itself, then the information it carries is not stable and unchanging, as required in ecological theory. Whether this makes any difference to studies of organizational ecology is an empirical question, but it should not be taken for granted. Understanding how change can occur within organizational routines enables us to shed new light on the debate about whether organizational change is episodic or continuous (Tushman and Romanelli, 1985; Gersick, 1991; Weick and Quinn, 1999). Theories of episodic change, or ""punctuated equilibrium,"" use the static conceptualization of organizational routines as a basis for the argument that organizations have structural inertia. According to this perspective on change, routines create inertia and resist change as long as possible, until exogenous forces overwhelm the structure and revolutionary change occurs. Theories of continuous change, by contrast, appear to ignore the inertial qualities of organizational routines. In this view, organizations can adapt to environmental pressure by continually modifying their routines.

,"Our theory encompasses both possibilities because it provides a way to begin explaining why routines sometimes display great inertia and sometimes do not. The tendency of a routine to change or remain the same depends on the processes of variation, selection, and retention that take place between the ostensive and performative aspects of the routine. Using these concepts, we can begin to hypothesize and test specific circumstances that promote these different kinds of change. Our theory further suggests that the explanatory factors may be at the level of the routine rather than at the level of the organization. The conditions for stability and for change may exist in the same organization and may manifest themselves differently from one routine to another. In her research, Feldman (2000, 2003) found that some routines in the same organization changed readily, while others did not. The differences in the adoption of change appear to have more to do with the internal dynamics of the routine than with organizational variables such as whether the participants thought the routine was functional and contributed to organizational goals, whether the managers supported the change, or which organizational units and cross-functional teams were involved.

CONCLUSION The conventional wisdom about routines is valuable, but it is only part of the story. While it is true that routines facilitate cognitive efficiency, they also embody a selective retention of history, filtered by subjectivity and power. The capacity of organizational routines to retain history can lead to inertia, but routines also generate variety. By directing attention to the performative, improvisational aspect of routines, our theory emphasizes the contingent and potentially contested nature of routines as a source of their variability. Our theory draws attention to mundane features of organizational routines that may be missed when they are seen through other theoretical lenses. In particular, they are produced by many people with different information, preferences, and interpretation, they are enacted over time and space, and they interact with other streams of action in such a way that it is not always clear where one organizational routine ends and another begins.

,"For these reasons, organizational routines always have the potential for change. A theory of organizational routines that includes agency, and, therefore, subjectivity and power, enables us to understand more about the dynamics of organizational routines and how these relate to stability, flexibility, and change in organizations. In this paper, we have emphasized that the ostensive and performative aspects of routines are mutually necessary. Without the ostensive aspect, we cannot name or even see our patterns of activity, much less reproduce them. Without the performative, nothing ever happens. Unfortunately, it is easy to confuse the ostensive aspect of the routine for the whole routine in much the same way that one might confuse the script for the play or the dictionary for the language. In daily conversation, these errors go unnoticed. After all, when we talk about the hiring routine or the budget routine, we are talking about the ostensive aspect. We are summarizing and abstracting. This language, however, has systematically led us away from investigating the role of performances and innovation in creating and shaping routines and thus away from the importance of agency, subjectivity, and power.

The results are similar, but not the same (“o” is no doubt more common in the “dogs” article because, after all, it occurs in the word “dog” itself). Still, if we take a large enough sample of English text we can expect to eventually get at least fairly consistent results:
Here’s a sample of what we get if we just generate a sequence of letters with these probabilities:
We can break this into “words” by adding in spaces as if they were letters with a certain probability:
We can do a slightly better job of making “words” by forcing the distribution of “word lengths” to agree with what it is in English:
We didn’t happen to get any “actual words” here, but the results are looking slightly better. To go further, though, we need to do more than just pick each letter separately at random. And, for example, we know that if we have a “q”, the next letter basically has to be “u”.

What Is a Model?
Say you want to know (as Galileo did back in the late 1500s) how long it’s going to take a cannon ball dropped from each floor of the Tower of Pisa to hit the ground. Well, you could just measure it in each case and make a table of the results. Or you could do what is the essence of theoretical science: make a model that gives some kind of procedure for computing the answer rather than just measuring and remembering each case.
Let’s imagine we have (somewhat idealized) data for how long the cannon ball takes to fall from various floors:
",931.0,232.0,,What is the big idea behind Generative Pre-trained Transformers and ChatGPT's core model?,Generative Pre-trained Transformers,,10,1686070719
,"How do we figure out how long it’s going to take to fall from a floor we don’t explicitly have data about? In this particular case, we can use known laws of physics to work it out. But say all we’ve got is the data, and we don’t know what underlying laws govern it. Then we might make a mathematical guess, like that perhaps we should use a straight line as a model:
We could pick different straight lines. But this is the one that’s on average closest to the data we’re given. And from this straight line we can estimate the time to fall for any floor.
How did we know to try using a straight line here? At some level we didn’t. It’s just something that’s mathematically simple, and we’re used to the fact that lots of data we measure turns out to be well fit by mathematically simple things. We could try something mathematically more complicated—say a + b x + c x2—and then in this case we do better:
Things can go quite wrong, though. Like here’s the best we can do with a + b/x + c sin(x):

,"It is worth understanding that there’s never a “model-less model”. Any model you use has some particular underlying structure—then a certain set of “knobs you can turn” (i.e. parameters you can set) to fit your data. And in the case of ChatGPT, lots of such “knobs” are used—actually, 175 billion of them.
But the remarkable thing is that the underlying structure of ChatGPT—with “just” that many parameters—is sufficient to make a model that computes next-word probabilities “well enough” to give us reasonable essay-length pieces of text.
Models for Human-Like Tasks
The example we gave above involves making a model for numerical data that essentially comes from simple physics—where we’ve known for several centuries that “simple mathematics applies”. But for ChatGPT we have to make a model of human-language text of the kind produced by a human brain. And for something like that we don’t (at least yet) have anything like “simple mathematics”. So what might a model of it be like?

,"Before we talk about language, let’s talk about another human-like task: recognizing images. And as a simple example of this, let’s consider images of digits (and, yes, this is a classic machine learning example):
One thing we could do is get a bunch of sample images for each digit:
Then to find out if an image we’re given as input corresponds to a particular digit we could just do an explicit pixel-by-pixel comparison with the samples we have. But as humans we certainly seem to do something better—because we can still recognize digits, even when they’re for example handwritten, and have all sorts of modifications and distortions:
When we made a model for our numerical data above, we were able to take a numerical value x that we were given, and just compute a + b x for particular a and b. So if we treat the gray-level value of each pixel here as some variable xi is there some function of all those variables that—when evaluated—tells us what digit the image is of? It turns out that it’s possible to construct such a function. Not surprisingly, it’s not particularly simple, though. And a typical example might involve perhaps half a million mathematical operations.
",1180.0,295.0,,How can we recognize images of digits without doing an explicit pixel-by-pixel comparison?,Generative Pre-trained Transformers,,1,1686370945
,"But the end result is that if we feed the collection of pixel values for an image into this function, out will come the number specifying which digit we have an image of. Later, we’ll talk about how such a function can be constructed, and the idea of neural nets. But for now let’s treat the function as black box, where we feed in images of, say, handwritten digits (as arrays of pixel values) and we get out the numbers these correspond to:
But what’s really going on here? Let’s say we progressively blur a digit. For a little while our function still “recognizes” it, here as a “2”. But soon it “loses it”, and starts giving the “wrong” result:
But why do we say it’s the “wrong” result? In this case, we know we got all the images by blurring a “2”. But if our goal is to produce a model of what humans can do in recognizing images, the real question to ask is what a human would have done if presented with one of those blurred images, without knowing where it came from.
",978.0,244.0,,How can we construct a function to recognize handwritten digits using neural nets?,Generative Pre-trained Transformers,,0,0
,"And we have a “good model” if the results we get from our function typically agree with what a human would say. And the nontrivial scientific fact is that for an image-recognition task like this we now basically know how to construct functions that do this.
Can we “mathematically prove” that they work? Well, no. Because to do that we’d have to have a mathematical theory of what we humans are doing. Take the “2” image and change a few pixels. We might imagine that with only a few pixels “out of place” we should still consider the image a “2”. But how far should that go? It’s a question of human visual perception. And, yes, the answer would no doubt be different for bees or octopuses—and potentially utterly different for putative aliens.
Neural Nets
OK, so how do our typical models for tasks like image recognition actually work? The most popular—and successful—current approach uses neural nets. Invented—in a form remarkably close to their use today—in the 1940s, neural nets can be thought of as simple idealizations of how brains seem to work.

,"In human brains there are about 100 billion neurons (nerve cells), each capable of producing an electrical pulse up to perhaps a thousand times a second. The neurons are connected in a complicated net, with each neuron having tree-like branches allowing it to pass electrical signals to perhaps thousands of other neurons. And in a rough approximation, whether any given neuron produces an electrical pulse at a given moment depends on what pulses it’s received from other neurons—with different connections contributing with different “weights”.
When we “see an image” what’s happening is that when photons of light from the image fall on (“photoreceptor”) cells at the back of our eyes they produce electrical signals in nerve cells. These nerve cells are connected to other nerve cells, and eventually the signals go through a whole sequence of layers of neurons. And it’s in this process that we “recognize” the image, eventually “forming the thought” that we’re “seeing a 2” (and maybe in the end doing something like saying the word “two” out loud).

(Of course, that’s not much different from how we might describe our brains as having been produced through the process of biological evolution.)
OK, but how does a neural net like this “recognize things”? The key is the notion of attractors. Imagine we’ve got handwritten images of 1’s and 2’s:
We somehow want all the 1’s to “be attracted to one place”, and all the 2’s to “be attracted to another place”. Or, put a different way, if an image is somehow “closer to being a 1” than to being a 2, we want it to end up in the “1 place” and vice versa.

,"As a straightforward analogy, let’s say we have certain positions in the plane, indicated by dots (in a real-life setting they might be positions of coffee shops). Then we might imagine that starting from any point on the plane we’d always want to end up at the closest dot (i.e. we’d always go to the closest coffee shop). We can represent this by dividing the plane into regions (“attractor basins”) separated by idealized “watersheds”:
We can think of this as implementing a kind of “recognition task” in which we’re not doing something like identifying what digit a given image “looks most like”—but rather we’re just, quite directly, seeing what dot a given point is closest to. (The “Voronoi diagram” setup we’re showing here separates points in 2D Euclidean space; the digit recognition task can be thought of as doing something very similar—but in a 784-dimensional space formed from the gray levels of all the pixels in each image.)

Each “neuron” is effectively set up to evaluate a simple numerical function.

The value of a given neuron is determined by multiplying the values of “previous neurons” by their corresponding weights, then adding these up and adding a constant—and finally applying a “thresholding” (or “activation”) function. In mathematical terms, if a neuron has inputs x = {x1, x2 …} then we compute f[w . x + b], where the weights w and constant b are generally chosen differently for each neuron in the network; the function f is usually the same.
Computing w . x + b is just a matter of matrix multiplication and addition. The “activation function” f introduces nonlinearity (and ultimately is what leads to nontrivial behavior). Various activation functions commonly get used; here we’ll just use Ramp (or ReLU):

,"For each task we want the neural net to perform (or, equivalently, for each overall function we want it to evaluate) we’ll have different choices of weights. (And—as we’ll discuss later—these weights are normally determined by “training” the neural net using machine learning from examples of the outputs we want.)
Ultimately, every neural net just corresponds to some overall mathematical function—though it may be messy to write out. For the example above, it would be:
The neural net of ChatGPT also just corresponds to a mathematical function like this—but effectively with billions of terms.
But let’s go back to individual neurons. Here are some examples of the functions a neuron with two inputs (representing coordinates x and y) can compute with various choices of weights and constants (and Ramp as activation function):

Bigger networks generally do better at approximating the function we’re aiming for. And in the “middle of each attractor basin” we typically get exactly the answer we want. But at the boundaries—where the neural net “has a hard time making up its mind”—things can be messier.
With this simple mathematical-style “recognition task” it’s clear what the “right answer” is. But in the problem of recognizing handwritten digits, it’s not so clear. What if someone wrote a “2” so badly it looked like a “7”, etc.? Still, we can ask how a neural net distinguishes digits—and this gives an indication:
Can we say “mathematically” how the network makes its distinctions? Not really. It’s just “doing what the neural net does”. But it turns out that that normally seems to agree fairly well with the distinctions we humans make.

Well, it’s straightforward to see what each “neuron” does when you show a picture of a cat. But even to get a basic visualization is usually very difficult.
In the final net that we used for the “nearest point” problem above there are 17 neurons. In the net for recognizing handwritten digits there are 2190. And in the net we’re using to recognize cats and dogs there are 60,650. Normally it would be pretty difficult to visualize what amounts to 60,650-dimensional space. But because this is a network set up to deal with images, many of its layers of neurons are organized into arrays, like the arrays of pixels it’s looking at.

But in general we might say that the neural net is “picking out certain features” (maybe pointy ears are among them), and using these to determine what the image is of. But are those features ones for which we have names—like “pointy ears”? Mostly not.
Are our brains using similar features? Mostly we don’t know. But it’s notable that the first few layers of a neural net like the one we’re showing here seem to pick out aspects of images (like edges of objects) that seem to be similar to ones we know are picked out by the first level of visual processing in brains.

But at least as of now we don’t have a way to “give a narrative description” of what the network is doing. And maybe that’s because it truly is computationally irreducible, and there’s no general way to find what it does except by explicitly tracing each step. Or maybe it’s just that we haven’t “figured out the science”, and identified the “natural laws” that allow us to summarize what’s going on.
We’ll encounter the same kinds of issues when we talk about generating language with ChatGPT. And again it’s not clear whether there are ways to “summarize what it’s doing”. But the richness and detail of language (and our experience with it) may allow us to get further than with images.

,"We’ve been talking so far about neural nets that “already know” how to do particular tasks. But what makes neural nets so useful (presumably also in brains) is that not only can they in principle do all sorts of tasks, but they can be incrementally “trained from examples” to do those tasks.
When we make a neural net to distinguish cats from dogs we don’t effectively have to write a program that (say) explicitly finds whiskers; instead we just show lots of examples of what’s a cat and what’s a dog, and then have the network “machine learn” from these how to distinguish them.
And the point is that the trained network “generalizes” from the particular examples it’s shown. Just as we’ve seen above, it isn’t simply that the network recognizes the particular pixel pattern of an example cat image it was shown; rather it’s that the neural net somehow manages to distinguish images on the basis of what we consider to be some kind of “general catness”.

,"So how does neural net training actually work? Essentially what we’re always trying to do is to find weights that make the neural net successfully reproduce the examples we’ve given. And then we’re relying on the neural net to “interpolate” (or “generalize”) “between” these examples in a “reasonable” way.
Let’s look at a problem even simpler than the nearest-point one above. Let’s just try to get a neural net to learn the function:
For this task, we’ll need a network that has just one input and one output, like:
But what weights, etc. should we be using? With every possible set of weights the neural net will compute some function. And, for example, here’s what it does with a few randomly chosen sets of weights:
And, yes, we can plainly see that in none of these cases does it get even close to reproducing the function we want. So how do we find weights that will reproduce the function?
The basic idea is to supply lots of “input → output” examples to “learn from”—and then to try to find weights that will reproduce these examples. Here’s the result of doing that with progressively more examples:
",1110.0,277.0,,How does neural net training work and what is the basic idea behind it?,Generative Pre-trained Transformers,,0,0
,"At each stage in this “training” the weights in the network are progressively adjusted—and we see that eventually we get a network that successfully reproduces the function we want. So how do we adjust the weights? The basic idea is at each stage to see “how far away we are” from getting the function we want—and then to update the weights in such a way as to get closer.
To find out “how far away we are” we compute what’s usually called a “loss function” (or sometimes “cost function”). Here we’re using a simple (L2) loss function that’s just the sum of the squares of the differences between the values we get, and the true values. And what we see is that as our training process progresses, the loss function progressively decreases (following a certain “learning curve” that’s different for different tasks)—until we reach a point where the network (at least to a good approximation) successfully reproduces the function we want:

,"Alright, so the last essential piece to explain is how the weights are adjusted to reduce the loss function. As we’ve said, the loss function gives us a “distance” between the values we’ve got, and the true values. But the “values we’ve got” are determined at each stage by the current version of neural net—and by the weights in it. But now imagine that the weights are variables—say wi. We want to find out how to adjust the values of these variables to minimize the loss that depends on them.
For example, imagine (in an incredible simplification of typical neural nets used in practice) that we have just two weights w1 and w2. Then we might have a loss that as a function of w1 and w2 looks like this:
Numerical analysis provides a variety of techniques for finding the minimum in cases like this. But a typical approach is just to progressively follow the path of steepest descent from whatever previous w1, w2 we had:
Like water flowing down a mountain, all that’s guaranteed is that this procedure will end up at some local minimum of the surface (“a mountain lake”); it might well not reach the ultimate global minimum.

As we mentioned above, one can always think of a neural net as computing a mathematical function—that depends on its inputs, and its weights. But now consider differentiating with respect to these weights. It turns out that the chain rule of calculus in effect lets us “unravel” the operations done by successive layers in the neural net. And the result is that we can—at least in some local approximation—“invert” the operation of the neural net, and progressively find weights that minimize the loss associated with the output.

And in fact the big breakthrough in “deep learning” that occurred around 2011 was associated with the discovery that in some sense it can be easier to do (at least approximate) minimization when there are lots of weights involved than when there are fairly few.
In other words—somewhat counterintuitively—it can be easier to solve more complicated problems with neural nets than simpler ones. And the rough reason for this seems to be that when one has a lot of “weight variables” one has a high-dimensional space with “lots of different directions” that can lead one to the minimum—whereas with fewer variables it’s easier to end up getting stuck in a local minimum (“mountain lake”) from which there’s no “direction to get out”.

,"It’s worth pointing out that in typical cases there are many different collections of weights that will all give neural nets that have pretty much the same performance. And usually in practical neural net training there are lots of random choices made—that lead to “different-but-equivalent solutions”, like these:
But each such “different solution” will have at least slightly different behavior. And if we ask, say, for an “extrapolation” outside the region where we gave training examples, we can get dramatically different results:
But which of these is “right”? There’s really no way to say. They’re all “consistent with the observed data”. But they all correspond to different “innate” ways to “think about” what to do “outside the box”. And some may seem “more reasonable” to us humans than others.

Sometimes—especially in retrospect—one can see at least a glimmer of a “scientific explanation” for something that’s being done. But mostly things have been discovered by trial and error, adding ideas and tricks that have progressively built a significant lore about how to work with neural nets.
There are several key parts. First, there’s the matter of what architecture of neural net one should use for a particular task. Then there’s the critical issue of how one’s going to get the data on which to train the neural net. And increasingly one isn’t dealing with training a net from scratch: instead a new net can either directly incorporate another already-trained net, or at least can use that net to generate more training examples for itself.

,"One might have thought that for every particular kind of task one would need a different architecture of neural net. But what’s been found is that the same architecture often seems to work even for apparently quite different tasks. At some level this reminds one of the idea of universal computation (and my Principle of Computational Equivalence), but, as I’ll discuss later, I think it’s more a reflection of the fact that the tasks we’re typically trying to get neural nets to do are “human-like” ones—and neural nets can capture quite general “human-like processes”.
In earlier days of neural nets, there tended to be the idea that one should “make the neural net do as little as possible”. For example, in converting speech to text it was thought that one should first analyze the audio of the speech, break it into phonemes, etc. But what was found is that—at least for “human-like tasks”—it’s usually better just to try to train the neural net on the “end-to-end problem”, letting it “discover” the necessary intermediate features, encodings, etc. for itself.

,"There was also the idea that one should introduce complicated individual components into the neural net, to let it in effect “explicitly implement particular algorithmic ideas”. But once again, this has mostly turned out not to be worthwhile; instead, it’s better just to deal with very simple components and let them “organize themselves” (albeit usually in ways we can’t understand) to achieve (presumably) the equivalent of those algorithmic ideas.
That’s not to say that there are no “structuring ideas” that are relevant for neural nets. Thus, for example, having 2D arrays of neurons with local connections seems at least very useful in the early stages of processing images. And having patterns of connectivity that concentrate on “looking back in sequences” seems useful—as we’ll see later—in dealing with things like human language, for example in ChatGPT.

And current neural nets—with current approaches to neural net training—specifically deal with arrays of numbers. But in the course of processing, those arrays can be completely rearranged and reshaped. And as an example, the network we used for identifying digits above starts with a 2D “image-like” array, quickly “thickening” to many channels, but then “concentrating down” into a 1D array that will ultimately contain elements representing the different possible output digits:

,"But, OK, how can one tell how big a neural net one will need for a particular task? It’s something of an art. At some level the key thing is to know “how hard the task is”. But for human-like tasks that’s typically very hard to estimate. Yes, there may be a systematic way to do the task very “mechanically” by computer. But it’s hard to know if there are what one might think of as tricks or shortcuts that allow one to do the task at least at a “human-like level” vastly more easily. It might take enumerating a giant game tree to “mechanically” play a certain game; but there might be a much easier (“heuristic”) way to achieve “human-level play”.
When one’s dealing with tiny neural nets and simple tasks one can sometimes explicitly see that one “can’t get there from here”. For example, here’s the best one seems to be able to do on the task from the previous section with a few small neural nets:

And, by the way, these pictures illustrate a piece of neural net lore: that one can often get away with a smaller network if there’s a “squeeze” in the middle that forces everything to go through a smaller intermediate number of neurons. (It’s also worth mentioning that “no-intermediate-layer”—or so-called “perceptron”—networks can only learn essentially linear functions—but as soon as there’s even one intermediate layer it’s always in principle possible to approximate any function arbitrarily well, at least if one has enough neurons, though to make it feasibly trainable one typically has some kind of regularization or normalization.)

And many of the practical challenges around neural nets—and machine learning in general—center on acquiring or preparing the necessary training data. In many cases (“supervised learning”) one wants to get explicit examples of inputs and the outputs one is expecting from them. Thus, for example, one might want images tagged by what’s in them, or some other attribute. And maybe one will have to explicitly go through—usually with great effort—and do the tagging. But very often it turns out to be possible to piggyback on something that’s already been done, or use it as some kind of proxy. And so, for example, one might use alt tags that have been provided for images on the web. Or, in a different domain, one might use closed captions that have been created for videos.

Certainly the requirements can be dramatically reduced by using “transfer learning” to “transfer in” things like lists of important features that have already been learned in another network. But generally neural nets need to “see a lot of examples” to train well. And at least for some tasks it’s an important piece of neural net lore that the examples can be incredibly repetitive. And indeed it’s a standard strategy to just show a neural net all the examples one has, over and over again. In each of these “training rounds” (or “epochs”) the neural net will be in at least a slightly different state, and somehow “reminding it” of a particular example is useful in getting it to “remember that example”.

,"OK, so what about the actual learning process in a neural net? In the end it’s all about determining what weights will best capture the training examples that have been given. And there are all sorts of detailed choices and “hyperparameter settings” (so called because the weights can be thought of as “parameters”) that can be used to tweak how this is done. There are different choices of loss function (sum of squares, sum of absolute values, etc.). There are different ways to do loss minimization (how far in weight space to move at each step, etc.). And then there are questions like how big a “batch” of examples to show to get each successive estimate of the loss one’s trying to minimize. And, yes, one can apply machine learning (as we do, for example, in Wolfram Language) to automate machine learning—and to automatically set things like hyperparameters.

Like for so many other things, there seem to be approximate power-law scaling relationships that depend on the size of neural net and amount of data one’s using. But the general conclusion is that training a neural net is hard—and takes a lot of computational effort.

In current neural nets, one’s essentially using the ideas of calculus—applied to real numbers—to do that incremental modification. But it’s increasingly clear that having high-precision numbers doesn’t matter; 8 bits or less might be enough even with current methods.
With computational systems like cellular automata that basically operate in parallel on many individual bits it’s never been clear how to do this kind of incremental modification, but there’s no reason to think it isn’t possible.

There are some computations which one might think would take many steps to do, but which can in fact be “reduced” to something quite immediate. But the discovery of computational irreducibility implies that this doesn’t always work. And instead there are processes—probably like the one below—where to work out what happens inevitably requires essentially tracing each computational step:

,"The kinds of things that we normally do with our brains are presumably specifically chosen to avoid computational irreducibility. It takes special effort to do math in one’s brain. And it’s in practice largely impossible to “think through” the steps in the operation of any nontrivial program just in one’s brain.
But of course for that we have computers. And with computers we can readily do long, computationally irreducible things. And the key point is that there’s in general no shortcut for these.
Yes, we could memorize lots of specific examples of what happens in some particular computational system. And maybe we could even see some (“computationally reducible”) patterns that would allow us to do a little generalization. But the point is that computational irreducibility means that we can never guarantee that the unexpected won’t happen—and it’s only by explicitly doing the computation that you can tell what actually happens in any particular case.

,"And in the end there’s just a fundamental tension between learnability and computational irreducibility. Learning involves in effect compressing data by leveraging regularities. But computational irreducibility implies that ultimately there’s a limit to what regularities there may be.
As a practical matter, one can imagine building little computational devices—like cellular automata or Turing machines—into trainable systems like neural nets. And indeed such devices can serve as good “tools” for the neural net—like Wolfram|Alpha can be a good tool for ChatGPT. But computational irreducibility implies that one can’t expect to “get inside” those devices and have them learn.
Or put another way, there’s an ultimate tradeoff between capability and trainability: the more you want a system to make “true use” of its computational capabilities, the more it’s going to show computational irreducibility, and the less it’s going to be trainable. And the more it’s fundamentally trainable, the less it’s going to be able to do sophisticated computation.

,"(For ChatGPT as it currently is, the situation is actually much more extreme, because the neural net used to generate each token of output is a pure “feed-forward” network, without loops, and therefore has no ability to do any kind of computation with nontrivial “control flow”.)
Of course, one might wonder whether it’s actually important to be able to do irreducible computations. And indeed for much of human history it wasn’t particularly important. But our modern technological world has been built on engineering that makes use of at least mathematical computations—and increasingly also more general computations. And if we look at the natural world, it’s full of irreducible computation—that we’re slowly understanding how to emulate and use for our technological purposes.
Yes, a neural net can certainly notice the kinds of regularities in the natural world that we might also readily notice with “unaided human thinking”. But if we want to work out things that are in the purview of mathematical or computational science the neural net isn’t going to be able to do it—unless it effectively “uses as a tool” an “ordinary” computational system.

,"But there’s something potentially confusing about all of this. In the past there were plenty of tasks—including writing essays—that we’ve assumed were somehow “fundamentally too hard” for computers. And now that we see them done by the likes of ChatGPT we tend to suddenly think that computers must have become vastly more powerful—in particular surpassing things they were already basically able to do (like progressively computing the behavior of computational systems like cellular automata).
But this isn’t the right conclusion to draw. Computationally irreducible processes are still computationally irreducible, and are still fundamentally hard for computers—even if computers can readily compute their individual steps. And instead what we should conclude is that tasks—like writing essays—that we humans could do, but we didn’t think computers could do, are actually in some sense computationally easier than we thought.

,"In other words, the reason a neural net can be successful in writing an essay is because writing an essay turns out to be a “computationally shallower” problem than we thought. And in a sense this takes us closer to “having a theory” of how we humans manage to do things like writing essays, or in general deal with language.
If you had a big enough neural net then, yes, you might be able to do whatever humans can readily do. But you wouldn’t capture what the natural world in general can do—or that the tools that we’ve fashioned from the natural world can do. And it’s the use of those tools—both practical and conceptual—that have allowed us in recent centuries to transcend the boundaries of what’s accessible to “pure unaided human thought”, and capture for human purposes more of what’s out there in the physical and computational universe.
The Concept of Embeddings
",875.0,218.0,,How does the success of a neural net in writing essays relate to human language abilities?,Generative Pre-trained Transformers,,0,0
,"Neural nets—at least as they’re currently set up—are fundamentally based on numbers. So if we’re going to to use them to work on something like text we’ll need a way to represent our text with numbers. And certainly we could start (essentially as ChatGPT does) by just assigning a number to every word in the dictionary. But there’s an important idea—that’s for example central to ChatGPT—that goes beyond that. And it’s the idea of “embeddings”. One can think of an embedding as a way to try to represent the “essence” of something by an array of numbers—with the property that “nearby things” are represented by nearby numbers.
And so, for example, we can think of a word embedding as trying to lay out words in a kind of “meaning space” in which words that are somehow “nearby in meaning” appear nearby in the embedding. The actual embeddings that are used—say in ChatGPT—tend to involve large lists of numbers. But if we project down to 2D, we can show examples of how words are laid out by the embedding:
",1010.0,252.0,,"How are words represented in a ""meaning space"" using embeddings in ChatGPT?",Generative Pre-trained Transformers,,0,0
,"And, yes, what we see does remarkably well in capturing typical everyday impressions. But how can we construct such an embedding? Roughly the idea is to look at large amounts of text (here 5 billion words from the web) and then see “how similar” the “environments” are in which different words appear. So, for example, “alligator” and “crocodile” will often appear almost interchangeably in otherwise similar sentences, and that means they’ll be placed nearby in the embedding. But “turnip” and “eagle” won’t tend to appear in otherwise similar sentences, so they’ll be placed far apart in the embedding.
But how does one actually implement something like this using neural nets? Let’s start by talking about embeddings not for words, but for images. We want to find some way to characterize images by lists of numbers in such a way that “images we consider similar” are assigned similar lists of numbers.
",906.0,226.0,,How are embeddings constructed for words and images using neural nets?,Generative Pre-trained Transformers,,0,0
,"How do we tell if we should “consider images similar”? Well, if our images are, say, of handwritten digits we might “consider two images similar” if they are of the same digit. Earlier we discussed a neural net that was trained to recognize handwritten digits. And we can think of this neural net as being set up so that in its final output it puts images into 10 different bins, one for each digit.
But what if we “intercept” what’s going on inside the neural net before the final “it’s a ‘4’” decision is made? We might expect that inside the neural net there are numbers that characterize images as being “mostly 4-like but a bit 2-like” or some such. And the idea is to pick up such numbers to use as elements in an embedding.
",731.0,182.0,,How can we use numbers inside a neural net to create an embedding for similar images?,Generative Pre-trained Transformers,,0,0
,"So here’s the concept. Rather than directly trying to characterize “what image is near what other image”, we instead consider a well-defined task (in this case digit recognition) for which we can get explicit training data—then use the fact that in doing this task the neural net implicitly has to make what amount to “nearness decisions”. So instead of us ever explicitly having to talk about “nearness of images” we’re just talking about the concrete question of what digit an image represents, and then we’re “leaving it to the neural net” to implicitly determine what that implies about “nearness of images”.
So how in more detail does this work for the digit recognition network? We can think of the network as consisting of 11 successive layers, that we might summarize iconically like this (with activation functions shown as separate layers):
At the beginning we’re feeding into the first layer actual images, represented by 2D arrays of pixel values. And at the end—from the last layer—we’re getting out an array of 10 values, which we can think of saying “how certain” the network is that the image corresponds to each of the digits 0 through 9.
",1156.0,289.0,,"How does the Generative Pre-trained Transformer approach digit recognition through implicit ""nearness decisions""?",Generative Pre-trained Transformers,,0,0
,"Feed in the image and the values of the neurons in that last layer are:
In other words, the neural net is by this point “incredibly certain” that this image is a 4—and to actually get the output “4” we just have to pick out the position of the neuron with the largest value.
But what if we look one step earlier? The very last operation in the network is a so-called softmax which tries to “force certainty”. But before that’s been applied the values of the neurons are:
The neuron representing “4” still has the highest numerical value. But there’s also information in the values of the other neurons. And we can expect that this list of numbers can in a sense be used to characterize the “essence” of the image—and thus to provide something we can use as an embedding. And so, for example, each of the 4’s here has a slightly different “signature” (or “feature embedding”)—all very different from the 8’s:
",908.0,227.0,,What is the significance of the values of the neurons in the last layer of a neural net?,Generative Pre-trained Transformers,,0,0
,"Here we’re essentially using 10 numbers to characterize our images. But it’s often better to use much more than that. And for example in our digit recognition network we can get an array of 500 numbers by tapping into the preceding layer. And this is probably a reasonable array to use as an “image embedding”.
If we want to make an explicit visualization of “image space” for handwritten digits we need to “reduce the dimension”, effectively by projecting the 500-dimensional vector we’ve got into, say, 3D space:
",515.0,128.0,,How can we effectively reduce the dimension of a 500-dimensional vector for image visualization?,Generative Pre-trained Transformers,,0,0
,"We’ve just talked about creating a characterization (and thus embedding) for images based effectively on identifying the similarity of images by determining whether (according to our training set) they correspond to the same handwritten digit. And we can do the same thing much more generally for images if we have a training set that identifies, say, which of 5000 common types of object (cat, dog, chair, …) each image is of. And in this way we can make an image embedding that’s “anchored” by our identification of common objects, but then “generalizes around that” according to the behavior of the neural net. And the point is that insofar as that behavior aligns with how we humans perceive and interpret images, this will end up being an embedding that “seems right to us”, and is useful in practice in doing “human-judgement-like” tasks.
",845.0,211.0,,How can we create a generalized image embedding that aligns with human perception and interpretation?,Generative Pre-trained Transformers,,0,0
,"OK, so how do we follow the same kind of approach to find embeddings for words? The key is to start from a task about words for which we can readily do training. And the standard such task is “word prediction”. Imagine we’re given “the ___ cat”. Based on a large corpus of text (say, the text content of the web), what are the probabilities for different words that might “fill in the blank”? Or, alternatively, given “___ black ___” what are the probabilities for different “flanking words”?
",493.0,123.0,,"How can we find embeddings for words using the standard task of ""word prediction""?",Generative Pre-trained Transformers,,0,0
,"How do we set this problem up for a neural net? Ultimately we have to formulate everything in terms of numbers. And one way to do this is just to assign a unique number to each of the 50,000 or so common words in English. So, for example, “the” might be 914, and “ cat” (with a space before it) might be 3542. (And these are the actual numbers used by GPT-2.) So for the “the ___ cat” problem, our input might be {914, 3542}. What should the output be like? Well, it should be a list of 50,000 or so numbers that effectively give the probabilities for each of the possible “fill-in” words. And once again, to find an embedding, we want to “intercept” the “insides” of the neural net just before it “reaches its conclusion”—and then pick up the list of numbers that occur there, and that we can think of as “characterizing each word”.
OK, so what do those characterizations look like? Over the past 10 years there’ve been a sequence of different systems developed (word2vec, GloVe, BERT, GPT, …), each based on a different neural net approach. But ultimately all of them take words and characterize them by lists of hundreds to thousands of numbers.
",1149.0,287.0,,How are words characterized in Generative Pre-trained Transformers and similar systems?,Generative Pre-trained Transformers,,0,0
,"In their raw form, these “embedding vectors” are quite uninformative. For example, here’s what GPT-2 produces as the raw embedding vectors for three specific words:
If we do things like measure distances between these vectors, then we can find things like “nearnesses” of words. Later we’ll discuss in more detail what we might consider the “cognitive” significance of such embeddings. But for now the main point is that we have a way to usefully turn words into “neural-net-friendly” collections of numbers.
But actually we can go further than just characterizing words by collections of numbers; we can also do this for sequences of words, or indeed whole blocks of text. And inside ChatGPT that’s how it’s dealing with things. It takes the text it’s got so far, and generates an embedding vector to represent it. Then its goal is to find the probabilities for different words that might occur next. And it represents its answer for this as a list of numbers that essentially give the probabilities for each of the 50,000 or so possible words.

,"(Strictly, ChatGPT does not deal with words, but rather with “tokens”—convenient linguistic units that might be whole words, or might just be pieces like “pre” or “ing” or “ized”. Working with tokens makes it easier for ChatGPT to handle rare, compound and non-English words, and, sometimes, for better or worse, to invent new words.)
Inside ChatGPT
OK, so we’re finally ready to discuss what’s inside ChatGPT. And, yes, ultimately, it’s a giant neural net—currently a version of the so-called GPT-3 network with 175 billion weights. In many ways this is a neural net very much like the other ones we’ve discussed. But it’s a neural net that’s particularly set up for dealing with language. And its most notable feature is a piece of neural net architecture called a “transformer”.
",782.0,195.0,,What is the most notable feature of ChatGPT's neural net architecture?,Generative Pre-trained Transformers,,0,0
,"In the first neural nets we discussed above, every neuron at any given layer was basically connected (at least with some weight) to every neuron on the layer before. But this kind of fully connected network is (presumably) overkill if one’s working with data that has particular, known structure. And thus, for example, in the early stages of dealing with images, it’s typical to use so-called convolutional neural nets (“convnets”) in which neurons are effectively laid out on a grid analogous to the pixels in the image—and connected only to neurons nearby on the grid.
The idea of transformers is to do something at least somewhat similar for sequences of tokens that make up a piece of text. But instead of just defining a fixed region in the sequence over which there can be connections, transformers instead introduce the notion of “attention”—and the idea of “paying attention” more to some parts of the sequence than others. Maybe one day it’ll make sense to just start a generic neural net and do all customization through training. But at least as of now it seems to be critical in practice to “modularize” things—as transformers do, and probably as our brains also do.
",1180.0,295.0,,"How do transformers introduce the notion of ""attention"" in processing sequences of tokens in text?",Generative Pre-trained Transformers,,0,0
,"OK, so what does ChatGPT (or, rather, the GPT-3 network on which it’s based) actually do? Recall that its overall goal is to continue text in a “reasonable” way, based on what it’s seen from the training it’s had (which consists in looking at billions of pages of text from the web, etc.) So at any given point, it’s got a certain amount of text—and its goal is to come up with an appropriate choice for the next token to add.
It operates in three basic stages. First, it takes the sequence of tokens that corresponds to the text so far, and finds an embedding (i.e. an array of numbers) that represents these. Then it operates on this embedding—in a “standard neural net way”, with values “rippling through” successive layers in a network—to produce a new embedding (i.e. a new array of numbers). It then takes the last part of this array and generates from it an array of about 50,000 values that turn into probabilities for different possible next tokens. (And, yes, it so happens that there are about the same number of tokens used as there are common words in English, though only about 3000 of the tokens are whole words, and the rest are fragments.)
",1157.0,289.0,,How does ChatGPT generate appropriate choices for the next token in a text sequence?,Generative Pre-trained Transformers,,0,0
,"A critical point is that every part of this pipeline is implemented by a neural network, whose weights are determined by end-to-end training of the network. In other words, in effect nothing except the overall architecture is “explicitly engineered”; everything is just “learned” from training data.
There are, however, plenty of details in the way the architecture is set up—reflecting all sorts of experience and neural net lore. And—even though this is definitely going into the weeds—I think it’s useful to talk about some of those details, not least to get a sense of just what goes into building something like ChatGPT.
First comes the embedding module. Here’s a schematic Wolfram Language representation for it for GPT-2:
",729.0,182.0,,How is every part of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer pipeline implemented?,Generative Pre-trained Transformers,,0,0
,"The input is a vector of n tokens (represented as in the previous section by integers from 1 to about 50,000). Each of these tokens is converted (by a single-layer neural net) into an embedding vector (of length 768 for GPT-2 and 12,288 for ChatGPT’s GPT-3). Meanwhile, there’s a “secondary pathway” that takes the sequence of (integer) positions for the tokens, and from these integers creates another embedding vector. And finally the embedding vectors from the token value and the token position are added together—to produce the final sequence of embedding vectors from the embedding module.
Why does one just add the token-value and token-position embedding vectors together? I don’t think there’s any particular science to this. It’s just that various different things have been tried, and this is one that seems to work. And it’s part of the lore of neural nets that—in some sense—so long as the setup one has is “roughly right” it’s usually possible to home in on details just by doing sufficient training, without ever really needing to “understand at an engineering level” quite how the neural net has ended up configuring itself.
",1141.0,285.0,,How are the token-value and token-position embedding vectors combined in Generative Pre-trained Transformers?,Generative Pre-trained Transformers,,0,0
,"Here’s what the embedding module does, operating on the string hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye:
The elements of the embedding vector for each token are shown down the page, and across the page we see first a run of “hello” embeddings, followed by a run of “bye” ones. The second array above is the positional embedding—with its somewhat-random-looking structure being just what “happened to be learned” (in this case in GPT-2).
OK, so after the embedding module comes the “main event” of the transformer: a sequence of so-called “attention blocks” (12 for GPT-2, 96 for ChatGPT’s GPT-3). It’s all pretty complicated—and reminiscent of typical large hard-to-understand engineering systems, or, for that matter, biological systems. But anyway, here’s a schematic representation of a single “attention block” (for GPT-2):
",887.0,221.0,,"What is the ""main event"" of the transformer after the embedding module in GPT-2?",Generative Pre-trained Transformers,,0,0
,"Within each such attention block there are a collection of “attention heads” (12 for GPT-2, 96 for ChatGPT’s GPT-3)—each of which operates independently on different chunks of values in the embedding vector. (And, yes, we don’t know any particular reason why it’s a good idea to split up the embedding vector, or what the different parts of it “mean”; this is just one of those things that’s been “found to work”.)
OK, so what do the attention heads do? Basically they’re a way of “looking back” in the sequence of tokens (i.e. in the text produced so far), and “packaging up the past” in a form that’s useful for finding the next token. In the first section above we talked about using 2-gram probabilities to pick words based on their immediate predecessors. What the “attention” mechanism in transformers does is to allow “attention to” even much earlier words—thus potentially capturing the way, say, verbs can refer to nouns that appear many words before them in a sentence.
",980.0,245.0,,What is the purpose of the attention heads in Generative Pre-trained Transformers?,Generative Pre-trained Transformers,,0,0
,"At a more detailed level, what an attention head does is to recombine chunks in the embedding vectors associated with different tokens, with certain weights. And so, for example, the 12 attention heads in the first attention block (in GPT-2) have the following (“look-back-all-the-way-to-the-beginning-of-the-sequence-of-tokens”) patterns of “recombination weights” for the “hello, bye” string above:
After being processed by the attention heads, the resulting “re-weighted embedding vector” (of length 768 for GPT-2 and length 12,288 for ChatGPT’s GPT-3) is passed through a standard “fully connected” neural net layer. It’s hard to get a handle on what this layer is doing. But here’s a plot of the 768×768 matrix of weights it’s using (here for GPT-2):
Taking 64×64 moving averages, some (random-walk-ish) structure begins to emerge:

,"What determines this structure? Ultimately it’s presumably some “neural net encoding” of features of human language. But as of now, what those features might be is quite unknown. In effect, we’re “opening up the brain of ChatGPT” (or at least GPT-2) and discovering, yes, it’s complicated in there, and we don’t understand it—even though in the end it’s producing recognizable human language.
OK, so after going through one attention block, we’ve got a new embedding vector—which is then successively passed through additional attention blocks (a total of 12 for GPT-2; 96 for GPT-3). Each attention block has its own particular pattern of “attention” and “fully connected” weights. Here for GPT-2 are the sequence of attention weights for the “hello, bye” input, for the first attention head:
And here are the (moving-averaged) “matrices” for the fully connected layers:
Curiously, even though these “matrices of weights” in different attention blocks look quite similar, the distributions of the sizes of weights can be somewhat different (and are not always Gaussian):

,"So after going through all these attention blocks what is the net effect of the transformer? Essentially it’s to transform the original collection of embeddings for the sequence of tokens to a final collection. And the particular way ChatGPT works is then to pick up the last embedding in this collection, and “decode” it to produce a list of probabilities for what token should come next.
So that’s in outline what’s inside ChatGPT. It may seem complicated (not least because of its many inevitably somewhat arbitrary “engineering choices”), but actually the ultimate elements involved are remarkably simple. Because in the end what we’re dealing with is just a neural net made of “artificial neurons”, each doing the simple operation of taking a collection of numerical inputs, and then combining them with certain weights.

There’s no looping or “going back”. Everything just “feeds forward” through the network.
It’s a very different setup from a typical computational system—like a Turing machine—in which results are repeatedly “reprocessed” by the same computational elements. Here—at least in generating a given token of output—each computational element (i.e. neuron) is used only once.

,"But there is in a sense still an “outer loop” that reuses computational elements even in ChatGPT. Because when ChatGPT is going to generate a new token, it always “reads” (i.e. takes as input) the whole sequence of tokens that come before it, including tokens that ChatGPT itself has “written” previously. And we can think of this setup as meaning that ChatGPT does—at least at its outermost level—involve a “feedback loop”, albeit one in which every iteration is explicitly visible as a token that appears in the text that it generates.
But let’s come back to the core of ChatGPT: the neural net that’s being repeatedly used to generate each token. At some level it’s very simple: a whole collection of identical artificial neurons. And some parts of the network just consist of (“fully connected”) layers of neurons in which every neuron on a given layer is connected (with some weight) to every neuron on the layer before. But particularly with its transformer architecture, ChatGPT has parts with more structure, in which only specific neurons on different layers are connected.

And for example—as the iconic summary above indicates—inside an attention block there are places where “multiple copies are made” of incoming data, each then going through a different “processing path”, potentially involving a different number of layers, and only later recombining. But while this may be a convenient representation of what’s going on, it’s always at least in principle possible to think of “densely filling in” layers, but just having some weights be zero.

Implementationally these calculations can be somewhat organized “by layer” into highly parallel array operations that can conveniently be done on GPUs. But for each token that’s produced, there still have to be 175 billion calculations done (and in the end a bit more)—so that, yes, it’s not surprising that it can take a while to generate a long piece of text with ChatGPT.

And that’s not even mentioning text derived from speech in videos, etc. (As a personal comparison, my total lifetime output of published material has been a bit under 3 million words, and over the past 30 years I’ve written about 15 million words of email, and altogether typed perhaps 50 million words—and in just the past couple of years I’ve spoken more than 10 million words on livestreams.

,"But, OK, given all this data, how does one train a neural net from it? The basic process is very much as we discussed it in the simple examples above. You present a batch of examples, and then you adjust the weights in the network to minimize the error (“loss”) that the network makes on those examples. The main thing that’s expensive about “back propagating” from the error is that each time you do this, every weight in the network will typically change at least a tiny bit, and there are just a lot of weights to deal with. (The actual “back computation” is typically only a small constant factor harder than the forward one.)
With modern GPU hardware, it’s straightforward to compute the results from batches of thousands of examples in parallel. But when it comes to actually updating the weights in the neural net, current methods require one to do this basically batch by batch. (And, yes, this is probably where actual brains—with their combined computation and memory elements—have, for now, at least an architectural advantage.)

So how many examples does this mean we’ll need in order to train a “human-like language” model? There doesn’t seem to be any fundamental “theoretical” way to know. But in practice ChatGPT was successfully trained on a few hundred billion words of text.
Some of the text it was fed several times, some of it only once. But somehow it “got what it needed” from the text it saw. But given this volume of text to learn from, how large a network should it require to “learn it well”? Again, we don’t yet have a fundamental theoretical way to say. Ultimately—as we’ll discuss further below—there’s presumably a certain “total algorithmic content” to human language and what humans typically say with it. But the next question is how efficient a neural net will be at implementing a model based on that algorithmic content. And again we don’t know—although the success of ChatGPT suggests it’s reasonably efficient.

In some ways it’s perhaps surprising (though empirically observed also in smaller analogs of ChatGPT) that the “size of the network” that seems to work well is so comparable to the “size of the training data”. After all, it’s certainly not that somehow “inside ChatGPT” all that text from the web and books and so on is “directly stored”. Because what’s actually inside ChatGPT are a bunch of numbers—with a bit less than 10 digits of precision—that are some kind of distributed encoding of the aggregate structure of all that text.

And then there’s the representation in the neural net of ChatGPT. That representation is very likely far from the “algorithmically minimal” representation (as we’ll discuss below). But it’s a representation that’s readily usable by the neural net. And in this representation it seems there’s in the end rather little “compression” of the training data; it seems on average to basically take only a bit less than one neural net weight to carry the “information content” of a word of training data.

But if we need about n words of training data to set up those weights, then from what we’ve said above we can conclude that we’ll need about n2 computational steps to do the training of the network—which is why, with current methods, one ends up needing to talk about billion-dollar training efforts.
Beyond Basic Training
The majority of the effort in training ChatGPT is spent “showing it” large amounts of existing text from the web, books, etc. But it turns out there’s another—apparently rather important—part too.

It’s not something one can readily detect, say, by doing traditional statistics on the text. But it’s something that actual humans reading the text easily notice.

,"And a key idea in the construction of ChatGPT was to have another step after “passively reading” things like the web: to have actual humans actively interact with ChatGPT, see what it produces, and in effect give it feedback on “how to be a good chatbot”. But how can the neural net use that feedback? The first step is just to have humans rate results from the neural net. But then another neural net model is built that attempts to predict those ratings. But now this prediction model can be run—essentially like a loss function—on the original network, in effect allowing that network to be “tuned up” by the human feedback that’s been given. And the results in practice seem to have a big effect on the success of the system in producing “human-like” output.
In general, it’s interesting how little “poking” the “originally trained” network seems to need to get it to usefully go in particular directions. One might have thought that to have the network behave as if it’s “learned something new” one would have to go in and run a training algorithm, adjusting weights, and so on.

Instead, it seems to be sufficient to basically tell ChatGPT something one time—as part of the prompt you give—and then it can successfully make use of what you told it when it generates text. And once again, the fact that this works is, I think, an important clue in understanding what ChatGPT is “really doing” and how it relates to the structure of human language and thinking.
There’s certainly something rather human-like about it: that at least once it’s had all that pre-training you can tell it something just once and it can “remember it”—at least “long enough” to generate a piece of text using it. So what’s going on in a case like this? It could be that “everything you might tell it is already in there somewhere”—and you’re just leading it to the right spot. But that doesn’t seem plausible. Instead, what seems more likely is that, yes, the elements are already in there, but the specifics are defined by something like a “trajectory between those elements” and that’s what you’re introducing when you tell it something.

It can “integrate” it only if it’s basically riding in a fairly simple way on top of the framework it already has.
It’s also worth pointing out again that there are inevitably “algorithmic limits” to what the neural net can “pick up”. Tell it “shallow” rules of the form “this goes to that”, etc., and the neural net will most likely be able to represent and reproduce these just fine—and indeed what it “already knows” from language will give it an immediate pattern to follow. But try to give it rules for an actual “deep” computation that involves many potentially computationally irreducible steps and it just won’t work.

Perhaps, one might have imagined, there’s something more to brains than their networks of neurons—like some new layer of undiscovered physics. But now with ChatGPT we’ve got an important new piece of information: we know that a pure, artificial neural network with about as many connections as brains have neurons is capable of doing a surprisingly good job of generating human language.

But at some level it still seems difficult to believe that all the richness of language and the things it can talk about can be encapsulated in such a finite system. Part of what’s going on is no doubt a reflection of the ubiquitous phenomenon (that first became evident in the example of rule 30) that computational processes can in effect greatly amplify the apparent complexity of systems even when their underlying rules are simple. But, actually, as we discussed above, neural nets of the kind used in ChatGPT tend to be specifically constructed to restrict the effect of this phenomenon—and the computational irreducibility associated with it—in the interest of making their training more accessible.

,"So how is it, then, that something like ChatGPT can get as far as it does with language? The basic answer, I think, is that language is at a fundamental level somehow simpler than it seems. And this means that ChatGPT—even with its ultimately straightforward neural net structure—is successfully able to “capture the essence” of human language and the thinking behind it. And moreover, in its training, ChatGPT has somehow “implicitly discovered” whatever regularities in language (and thinking) make this possible.
The success of ChatGPT is, I think, giving us evidence of a fundamental and important piece of science: it’s suggesting that we can expect there to be major new “laws of language”—and effectively “laws of thought”—out there to discover. In ChatGPT—built as it is as a neural net—those laws are at best implicit. But if we could somehow make the laws explicit, there’s the potential to do the kinds of things ChatGPT does in vastly more direct, efficient—and transparent—ways.
",992.0,248.0,,How does ChatGPT capture the essence of human language and thinking?,Generative Pre-trained Transformers,,0,0

Later we’ll discuss how “looking inside ChatGPT” may be able to give us some hints about this, and how what we know from building computational language suggests a path forward. But first let’s discuss two long-known examples of what amount to “laws of language”—and how they relate to the operation of ChatGPT.
The first is the syntax of language. Language is not just a random jumble of words. Instead, there are (fairly) definite grammatical rules for how words of different kinds can be put together: in English, for example, nouns can be preceded by adjectives and followed by verbs, but typically two nouns can’t be right next to each other. Such grammatical structure can (at least approximately) be captured by a set of rules that define how what amount to “parse trees” can be put together:
",963.0,240.0,,"What are the two long-known examples of ""laws of language"" and how do they relate to ChatGPT?",Generative Pre-trained Transformers,,0,0
,"ChatGPT doesn’t have any explicit “knowledge” of such rules. But somehow in its training it implicitly “discovers” them—and then seems to be good at following them. So how does this work? At a “big picture” level it’s not clear. But to get some insight it’s perhaps instructive to look at a much simpler example.
Consider a “language” formed from sequences of (’s and )’s, with a grammar that specifies that parentheses should always be balanced, as represented by a parse tree like:
Can we train a neural net to produce “grammatically correct” parenthesis sequences? There are various ways to handle sequences in neural nets, but let’s use transformer nets, as ChatGPT does. And given a simple transformer net, we can start feeding it grammatically correct parenthesis sequences as training examples. A subtlety (which actually also appears in ChatGPT’s generation of human language) is that in addition to our “content tokens” (here “(” and “)”) we have to include an “End” token, that’s generated to indicate that the output shouldn’t continue any further (i.e. for ChatGPT, that one’s reached the “end of the story”).

,"If we set up a transformer net with just one attention block with 8 heads and feature vectors of length 128 (ChatGPT also uses feature vectors of length 128, but has 96 attention blocks, each with 96 heads) then it doesn’t seem possible to get it to learn much about parenthesis language. But with 2 attention blocks, the learning process seems to converge—at least after 10 million or so examples have been given (and, as is common with transformer nets, showing yet more examples just seems to degrade its performance).
So with this network, we can do the analog of what ChatGPT does, and ask for probabilities for what the next token should be—in a parenthesis sequence:
",674.0,168.0,,How many attention blocks are needed for the transformer net to learn about parenthesis language?,Generative Pre-trained Transformers,,0,0
,"And in the first case, the network is “pretty sure” that the sequence can’t end here—which is good, because if it did, the parentheses would be left unbalanced. In the second case, however, it “correctly recognizes” that the sequence can end here, though it also “points out” that it’s possible to “start again”, putting down a “(”, presumably with a “)” to follow. But, oops, even with its 400,000 or so laboriously trained weights, it says there’s a 15% probability to have “)” as the next token—which isn’t right, because that would necessarily lead to an unbalanced parenthesis.
Here’s what we get if we ask the network for the highest-probability completions for progressively longer sequences of (’s:

It’s a pretty typical kind of thing to see in a “precise” situation like this with a neural net (or with machine learning in general). Cases that a human “can solve in a glance” the neural net can solve too. But cases that require doing something “more algorithmic” (e.g. explicitly counting parentheses to see if they’re closed) the neural net tends to somehow be “too computationally shallow” to reliably do. (By the way, even the full current ChatGPT has a hard time correctly matching parentheses in long sequences.)

But in English it’s much more realistic to be able to “guess” what’s grammatically going to fit on the basis of local choices of words and other hints. And, yes, the neural net is much better at this—even though perhaps it might miss some “formally correct” case that, well, humans might miss as well. But the main point is that the fact that there’s an overall syntactic structure to the language—with all the regularity that implies—in a sense limits “how much” the neural net has to learn. And a key “natural-science-like” observation is that the transformer architecture of neural nets like the one in ChatGPT seems to successfully be able to learn the kind of nested-tree-like syntactic structure that seems to exist (at least in some approximation) in all human languages.

A sentence like “Inquisitive electrons eat blue theories for fish” is grammatically correct but isn’t something one would normally expect to say, and wouldn’t be considered a success if ChatGPT generated it—because, well, with the normal meanings for the words in it, it’s basically meaningless.
But is there a general way to tell if a sentence is meaningful? There’s no traditional overall theory for that. But it’s something that one can think of ChatGPT as having implicitly “developed a theory for” after being trained with billions of (presumably meaningful) sentences from the web, etc.

,"What might this theory be like? Well, there’s one tiny corner that’s basically been known for two millennia, and that’s logic. And certainly in the syllogistic form in which Aristotle discovered it, logic is basically a way of saying that sentences that follow certain patterns are reasonable, while others are not. Thus, for example, it’s reasonable to say “All X are Y. This is not Y, so it’s not an X” (as in “All fishes are blue. This is not blue, so it’s not a fish.”). And just as one can somewhat whimsically imagine that Aristotle discovered syllogistic logic by going (“machine-learning-style”) through lots of examples of rhetoric, so too one can imagine that in the training of ChatGPT it will have been able to “discover syllogistic logic” by looking at lots of text on the web, etc. (And, yes, while one can therefore expect ChatGPT to produce text that contains “correct inferences” based on things like syllogistic logic, it’s a quite different story when it comes to more sophisticated formal logic—and I think one can expect it to fail here for the same kind of reasons it fails in parenthesis matching.)

Yes, there are things like Mad Libs that use very specific “phrasal templates”. But somehow ChatGPT implicitly has a much more general way to do it. And perhaps there’s nothing to be said about how it can be done beyond “somehow it happens when you have 175 billion neural net weights”. But I strongly suspect that there’s a much simpler and stronger story.
Meaning Space and Semantic Laws of Motion
We discussed above that inside ChatGPT any piece of text is effectively represented by an array of numbers that we can think of as coordinates of a point in some kind of “linguistic feature space”. So when ChatGPT continues a piece of text this corresponds to tracing out a trajectory in linguistic feature space. But now we can ask what makes this trajectory correspond to text we consider meaningful. And might there perhaps be some kind of “semantic laws of motion” that define—or at least constrain—how points in linguistic feature space can move around while preserving “meaningfulness”?
",1135.0,283.0,,"What are the ""semantic laws of motion"" that constrain how points in linguistic feature space move?",Generative Pre-trained Transformers,,0,0
,"So what is this linguistic feature space like? Here’s an example of how single words (here, common nouns) might get laid out if we project such a feature space down to 2D:
We saw another example above based on words representing plants and animals. But the point in both cases is that “semantically similar words” are placed nearby.
As another example, here’s how words corresponding to different parts of speech get laid out:
Of course, a given word doesn’t in general just have “one meaning” (or necessarily correspond to just one part of speech). And by looking at how sentences containing a word lay out in feature space, one can often “tease apart” different meanings—as in the example here for the word “crane” (bird or machine?):
OK, so it’s at least plausible that we can think of this feature space as placing “words nearby in meaning” close in this space. But what kind of additional structure can we identify in this space? Is there for example some kind of notion of “parallel transport” that would reflect “flatness” in the space? One way to get a handle on that is to look at analogies:
",1101.0,275.0,,"How can we identify additional structure in the linguistic feature space, and what are analogies?",Generative Pre-trained Transformers,,0,0
,"And, yes, even when we project down to 2D, there’s often at least a “hint of flatness”, though it’s certainly not universally seen.
So what about trajectories? We can look at the trajectory that a prompt for ChatGPT follows in feature space—and then we can see how ChatGPT continues that:
There’s certainly no “geometrically obvious” law of motion here. And that’s not at all surprising; we fully expect this to be a considerably more complicated story. And, for example, it’s far from obvious that even if there is a “semantic law of motion” to be found, what kind of embedding (or, in effect, what “variables”) it’ll most naturally be stated in.
In the picture above, we’re showing several steps in the “trajectory”—where at each step we’re picking the word that ChatGPT considers the most probable (the “zero temperature” case). But we can also ask what words can “come next” with what probabilities at a given point:
And what we see in this case is that there’s a “fan” of high-probability words that seems to go in a more or less definite direction in feature space. What happens if we go further? Here are the successive “fans” that appear as we “move along” the trajectory:

And, yes, this seems like a mess—and doesn’t do anything to particularly encourage the idea that one can expect to identify “mathematical-physics-like” “semantic laws of motion” by empirically studying “what ChatGPT is doing inside”. But perhaps we’re just looking at the “wrong variables” (or wrong coordinate system) and if only we looked at the right one, we’d immediately see that ChatGPT is doing something “mathematical-physics-simple” like following geodesics. But as of now, we’re not ready to “empirically decode” from its “internal behavior” what ChatGPT has “discovered” about how human language is “put together”.

But now we know it can be done quite respectably by the neural net of ChatGPT. Still, maybe that’s as far as we can go, and there’ll be nothing simpler—or more human understandable—that will work. But my strong suspicion is that the success of ChatGPT implicitly reveals an important “scientific” fact: that there’s actually a lot more structure and simplicity to meaningful human language than we ever knew—and that in the end there may be even fairly simple rules that describe how such language can be put together.
As we mentioned above, syntactic grammar gives rules for how words corresponding to things like different parts of speech can be put together in human language. But to deal with meaning, we need to go further. And one version of how to do this is to think about not just a syntactic grammar for language, but also a semantic one.
",986.0,246.0,,What is the difference between syntactic and semantic grammar in relation to human language?,Generative Pre-trained Transformers,,0,0
,"For purposes of syntax, we identify things like nouns and verbs. But for purposes of semantics, we need “finer gradations”.

There are endless specific examples of each of these “semantic concepts”. But for the purposes of our semantic grammar, we’ll just have some general kind of rule that basically says that “objects” can “move”. There’s a lot to say about how all this might work (some of which I’ve said before). But I’ll content myself here with just a few remarks that indicate some of the potential path forward.
It’s worth mentioning that even if a sentence is perfectly OK according to the semantic grammar, that doesn’t mean it’s been realized (or even could be realized) in practice. “The elephant traveled to the Moon” would doubtless “pass” our semantic grammar, but it certainly hasn’t been realized (at least yet) in our actual world—though it’s absolutely fair game for a fictional world.

Until recent times, we might have imagined that (human) language would be the only general way to describe our “model of the world”. Already a few centuries ago there started to be formalizations of specific kinds of things, based particularly on mathematics.

And, after decades of work, we’ve covered a lot of areas in this way. But in the past, we haven’t particularly dealt with “everyday discourse”. In “I bought two pounds of apples” we can readily represent (and do nutrition and other computations on) the “two pounds of apples”. But we don’t (quite yet) have a symbolic representation for “I bought”.
It’s all connected to the idea of semantic grammar—and the goal of having a generic symbolic “construction kit” for concepts, that would give us rules for what could fit together with what, and thus for the “flow” of what we might turn into human language.

Given a symbolic discourse language we might use it to make “standalone statements”. But we can also use it to ask questions about the world, “Wolfram|Alpha style”.

But in computational language we have to be precise and clear about all the distinctions we’re making.

But (yes, two millennia later) when formal logic was developed, the original basic constructs of syllogistic logic could now be used to build huge “formal towers” that include, for example, the operation of modern digital circuitry. And so, we can expect, it will be with more general semantic grammar. At first, it may just be able to deal with simple patterns, expressed, say, as text. But once its whole computational language framework is built, we can expect that it will be able to be used to erect tall towers of “generalized semantic logic”, that allow us to work in a precise and formal way with all sorts of things that have never been accessible to us before, except just at a “ground-floor level” through human language, with all its vagueness.

,"We can think of the construction of computational language—and semantic grammar—as representing a kind of ultimate compression in representing things. Because it allows us to talk about the essence of what’s possible, without, for example, dealing with all the “turns of phrase” that exist in ordinary human language. And we can view the great strength of ChatGPT as being something a bit similar: because it too has in a sense “drilled through” to the point where it can “put language together in a semantically meaningful way” without concern for different possible turns of phrase.

,"So what would happen if we applied ChatGPT to underlying computational language? The computational language can describe what’s possible. But what can still be added is a sense of “what’s popular”—based for example on reading all that content on the web. But then—underneath—operating with computational language means that something like ChatGPT has immediate and fundamental access to what amount to ultimate tools for making use of potentially irreducible computations. And that makes it a system that can not only “generate reasonable text”, but can expect to work out whatever can be worked out about whether that text actually makes “correct” statements about the world—or whatever it’s supposed to be talking about.
So … What Is ChatGPT Doing, and Why Does It Work?
The basic concept of ChatGPT is at some level rather simple. Start from a huge sample of human-created text from the web, books, etc. Then train a neural net to generate text that’s “like this”. And in particular, make it able to start from a “prompt” and then continue with text that’s “like what it’s been trained with”.

,"As we’ve seen, the actual neural net in ChatGPT is made up of very simple elements—though billions of them. And the basic operation of the neural net is also very simple, consisting essentially of passing input derived from the text it’s generated so far “once through its elements” (without any loops, etc.) for every new word (or part of a word) that it generates.
But the remarkable—and unexpected—thing is that this process can produce text that’s successfully “like” what’s out there on the web, in books, etc. And not only is it coherent human language, it also “says things” that “follow its prompt” making use of content it’s “read”. It doesn’t always say things that “globally make sense” (or correspond to correct computations)—because (without, for example, accessing the “computational superpowers” of Wolfram|Alpha) it’s just saying things that “sound right” based on what things “sounded like” in its training material.

,"The specific engineering of ChatGPT has made it quite compelling. But ultimately (at least until it can use outside tools) ChatGPT is “merely” pulling out some “coherent thread of text” from the “statistics of conventional wisdom” that it’s accumulated. But it’s amazing how human-like the results are. And as I’ve discussed, this suggests something that’s at least scientifically very important: that human language (and the patterns of thinking behind it) are somehow simpler and more “law like” in their structure than we thought. ChatGPT has implicitly discovered it. But we can potentially explicitly expose it, with semantic grammar, computational language, etc.
What ChatGPT does in generating text is very impressive—and the results are usually very much like what we humans would produce. So does this mean ChatGPT is working like a brain? Its underlying artificial-neural-net structure was ultimately modeled on an idealization of the brain. And it seems quite likely that when we humans generate language many aspects of what’s going on are quite similar.

,"When it comes to training (AKA learning) the different “hardware” of the brain and of current computers (as well as, perhaps, some undeveloped algorithmic ideas) forces ChatGPT to use a strategy that’s probably rather different (and in some ways much less efficient) than the brain. And there’s something else as well: unlike even in typical algorithmic computation, ChatGPT doesn’t internally “have loops” or “recompute on data”. And that inevitably limits its computational capability—even with respect to current computers, but definitely with respect to the brain.
It’s not clear how to “fix that” and still maintain the ability to train the system with reasonable efficiency. But to do so will presumably allow a future ChatGPT to do even more “brain-like things”. Of course, there are plenty of things that brains don’t do so well—particularly involving what amount to irreducible computations. And for these both brains and things like ChatGPT have to seek “outside tools”—like Wolfram Language.

,"But for now it’s exciting to see what ChatGPT has already been able to do. At some level it’s a great example of the fundamental scientific fact that large numbers of simple computational elements can do remarkable and unexpected things. But it also provides perhaps the best impetus we’ve had in two thousand years to understand better just what the fundamental character and principles might be of that central feature of the human condition that is human language and the processes of thinking behind it.
