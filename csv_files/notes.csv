Finicum, author of the apocalyptic novel Only by Blood and Suffering: Regaining Lost Freedom, was shot on January 26, 2016, shortly after he was recorded on video shouting at officers, “You want a bloodbath? It’s going to be on your hands.”37 Officers maintain that Finicum was shot while reaching for a gun. Ryan Bundy was injured at the scene and arrested. Ammon was arrested shortly after. A few days later, Cliven Bundy was arrested while trying to board a plane to Oregon to join the fight with his sons. On February 12, forty-one days after Ammon first marched his armed group into the Malheur offices, the last holdouts at the reserve surrendered to authorities, and the standoff was over. Law enforcement officers confiscated dozens of guns and over sixteen thousand rounds of ammunition from the site.the occupation",2023-08-10

Plenty of people of color have met the white antiracist who is all for Dr. King’s dream until people of color start asking white people to make actual sacrifices for racial justice. Ego can undermine even the best of intentions, but often, when things like this happen—when someone we trust as an ally ends up taking advantage of their position and then turning against the principles they once claimed to fight for when that abuse is discovered—we find that the intentions were never that great in the first place.plenty of women",2023-08-10
Ijeoma Oluo,Mediocre,"[Note] Biden got the message. If he continued to defend busing, he ran the real risk of becoming a one-term senator. In 1975, Joe Biden stunned his Senate colleagues by throwing his support behind known segregationist Jesse Helms’s proposed antibusing amendment to the Constitution. Speaking in defense of Helms’s amendment, Biden told the Senate, “I have become convinced that busing is a bankrupt concept.”19 In a later television interview, Biden warned that if the US government didn’t come up with a different solution for school segregation than busing, “we are going to end up with the races at war.” Biden explained that the good white people he represented weren’t racist, but busing might make them so: “You take people who aren’t racist, people who are good citizens, who believe in equal education and opportunity, and you stunt their children’s intellectual growth by busing them to an inferior school and you’re going to fill them with hatred.”20 Biden’s argument was that the white Northerners who had benefitted from schools that consolidated white wealth and excluded Black students from sharing in that wealth with legislation that kept their districts (and the corresponding property taxes and PTA funding opportunities) separate were not racist, but subjecting them to the same education that Black students had long been forced to endure would make them racist.biden got",2023-08-10
Ijeoma Oluo,Mediocre,"After busing was dismantled nationally, the “other methods” of desegregating schools that Biden insisted were more effective than busing never materialized. Without federal mandate forcing integration, schools slowly resegregated, and their funding followed. [Note] A 2019 report showed that nonwhite school districts received $23 billion less per year than their white counterparts. Even when controlled for income discrepancies, the funding was less, with poor white schools still receiving more funds than poor schools where the majority of the students were people of color.32 Funding disparities and the concentration of underprivileged students in schools with fewer resources than wealthier white schools have also led to a higher turnover of teachers in nonwhite schools. This all has contributed to persistent testing gaps between white students and Black, brown, and Native students. Biden’s home state of Delaware, like many states that were once ordered to use busing to desegregate their schools, has been resegregating in the years since busing ended. Busing there had been very successful at desegregating schools. In 1989, there were no intensely segregated (i.e., 90–100 percent minority-student) schools in the metro Wilmington area. But by 2010, the number of intensely segregated schools had grown to 15 percent. The average Latinx student in Wilmington attended a school where 61 percent of students were low income, and the average Black student attended a school where 56 percent of students were low income, while the average white student attended a school where only 37 percent of the students were low income.33 As racial disparities in educational funding and outcomes returned to Delaware, parents of color once again brought their case to the courts in hopes of obtaining equitable educational opportunities for their children. In a 2018 case, the state of Delaware argued in its defense that the Constitution doesn’t require that the state provide the children of Delaware with a fair or “adequate” education system.34",2023-08-10

It has come to stand for what some see as the stereotypical supersupporter of Sanders: a young, white man who will vigorously defend Sanders from any negative comment—usually with long lectures explaining how the commenter doesn’t understand politics or doesn’t care about poor people, people of color, and women if they don’t support Bernie, even if the person he is lecturing happens to be a woman of color.",2023-08-10

Ijeoma Oluo,Mediocre,"[Note] This claim that the focus on identity distracts from “real” politics—while simultaneously centering how “identity politics” affect white men and claiming not to be engaging in identity politics—is a tightrope of hypocrisy that Sanders himself likes to walk. Let’s be clear: centering the needs of progressive, working-class, white men is identity politics. It is just as steeped in individual identity as movements focusing on women and people of color. But it comes with a level of privilege built in that allows it to escape wider scrutiny. Here is an excerpt from an interview that Sanders gave GQ magazine in 2019:",2023-08-10

Ijeoma Oluo,Mediocre,"[Note] Reagan’s disdain for higher education—especially government funding for higher education—was both political and personal in nature. In his run for governor of California in 1966, Reagan successfully campaigned in part on a pledge to “clean up” UC Berkeley. Outraged at 1960s protests against the Vietnam War, Reagan painted a picture of spoiled hippie kids learning to be ungrateful while living on taxpayer money. Once elected governor, Reagan had UC president Clark Kerr fired, violently cracked down on student protests (in 1969, the police response to one such protest—at the People’s Park in Berkeley—left one student dead and dozens of students wounded), and immediately began undermining the UC system’s programs to keep college financially attainable to any student who wished to attend.25 Having practiced on the University of California system, Reagan, once he became president of the United States, took his educational reforms national. He passed sweeping tax and spending cuts that slashed funding for students, making college more expensive and inaccessible to those who needed it the most. Due to the racial economic disparities in America, students of color were often more likely to need the financial assistance and educational programs that the US government had previously funded and were therefore some of the most greatly impacted by Reagan’s funding cuts. But at a time when middle- and working-class white America was dissatisfied with slower economic growth and increased competition at home (from women workers and workers of color) and abroad (from the rise in foreign manufacturing), Reagan was not punished politically for cutting the feet out from under underprivileged students. He was rewarded with reelection and the highest approval ratings since Franklin Roosevelt.26",2023-08-10

Ijeoma Oluo,Mediocre,"[Note] Not content to just gauge public opinion, government officials aimed to shape it. Propaganda was targeted to women (like that developed by the Magazine Bureau), but pamphlets and short films were also produced to mold male opinions on working women. One pamphlet commissioned from the American Historical Association (AHA) by the War Department, titled Do You Want Your Wife to Work After the War?, was a discussion guide of sorts that endeavored to get GIs thinking about how they would handle the presence of women workers when they returned home. Covering historical opinions, the pamphlet highlighted flaws in past hostility toward women workers (while reaffirming how understandable those attitudes were) in order to soften men’s views toward women’s employment. It featured a fictionalized discussion between two soldiers on the pros and cons of women workers. One soldier argued that while most women were happy to be wives and mothers, many also needed the excitement and purpose of outside employment. He talked about the financial benefits and security of having a wife who was also bringing in income. The second soldier argued that women workers would be in direct competition with returning soldiers for employment, and that they would abandon their wifely and motherly duties in order to keep a job that should go to a man. “How about competition from these women that are staying on the job to support guys like you?” the second soldier argued. “They’re going to make it harder for me to do it my way.” The debate on the surface seemed to evenly represent the issue—if we ignore the fact that the entire debate is situated within the needs, desires, and opinions of men. The final section of the pamphlet—titled “Some Attempts to Solve the Women Problem”—lists possible ways to deal with women workers after the war, including those who wanted to keep working. Possible solutions include treating housework and child-rearing more like “a profession” and establishing training programs on household management. Another is to pay women not to work. The prospect of women staying in the workplace so long as men helped them with household chores in order to lighten their burden is briefly floated but immediately dismissed as too upsetting to the “traditional scheme of things.”27 While the pamphlet was initially framed as an impartial document in support of the war effort, the American History Association now acknowledges that it and other organizations like it were a part of the war machine intended to shape public opinion instead of merely gauging or reflecting it. The AHA admits that it “tailored its pamphlets to paint an idealized image of a postwar world that was essentially free of minorities, where women happily moved out of the factories and back into the kitchen, and where America would largely dominate the world stage.”28 I’m sure that many in the War Office congratulated themselves on the success of their propaganda campaigns (and celebrated them as proof of the suggestible nature of women). But it is likely that a large percentage of the 6.5 million women who worked did so because they needed to support themselves and their families. Perhaps they had always wanted to work but had previously been denied decent-paying jobs.29 Regardless of why they started, once the war was over many women wanted to keep working. The efforts of the US government may have helped cement public opinion overall against women working after the war; studies showed that when asked what to do with women workers postwar, 48 percent of respondents said “fire them” and an additional 36 percent said “fire them, unless they have dependents, or are war widows, or there are plenty of jobs.” The government was far less successful in getting the women who were doing the work to eagerly give it up.30 Studies and polls conducted in 1944 of working women showed that 75–80 percent of them wanted to keep their jobs after the war ended.31 Apparently, they decided to risk the possibility of divorce, infertility, and death that True Story had warned them of for daring to want to work for any other reason than to bring soldiers home.",2023-08-10
Ijeoma Oluo,Mediocre,"[Note] “Why,” he asked me in conclusion, “don’t people of color care more about important political issues?” Many white men see a political landscape dominated by white men and think it is that way because white men are just more politically minded. They think that the absence of women and people of color from powerful rooms is due to self-selection. They do not question how unwelcoming the room they have built might be. They do not question whether or not the discussions they are having in that room are inclusive and generate productive discussions for women and people of color. They don’t ask if there are other, equally important conversations happening in other rooms. And they don’t even bother to ask if anyone unlocked the door. They look at the room and say that women and people of color aren’t in it because women and people of color aren’t interested. Then they cite this supposed disinterest as proof that women and people of color are too unqualified to even be invited in. I tried to raise the possibility that maybe a room full of white people in one of the whitest states in the country was not the most welcoming to people of color. I tried to assure him not only that people of color cared about the environment, but that Indigenous people actually invented the environmentalism he was claiming as his own. But he didn’t want to hear me. He finally shook his head and said, “Well, we don’t have to agree on all that.” As he walked away and I went back to teaching the class, I couldn’t help but imagine how this man would react if the people of color who had long been fighting to protect the environment and protect people of color from the devastating environmental impacts of white supremacist capitalism were to just show up at his next environmental club meeting. I don’t think he’d love it as much as he claims. While we like to give lip service to the diversity and open opportunity of our political process, the truth is that much of white America completely ignores the political lives of people of color—especially women of color. We are often seen as a reliably Democratic voting bloc, to be pulled out each election cycle to vote for a mediocre white Democratic candidate and then put back in storage until the next election. At least that’s how white Democrats see us. Many white Republicans also see us as a reliably Democratic voting bloc, to be prevented from exercising our right to vote at all costs. Sure, one is worse than the other, but both are pretty shitty.",2023-08-10

In the course of my research I came across the impressively named tactile situation awareness system (TSAS): a vest designed for airforce pilots and fitted with thirty-two sensors that vibrate if the pilot needs to correct her position; pilots can sometimes lose track of where they are in space and cannot tell if they are heading up or down. I say her, because a review of ‘Tactile Sensitivity and Human Tactile Interfaces’ explained that ‘The TSAS allows the pilot to always know his orientation with respect to the ground’. 42  The pronoun choice seems relevant given that the review later casually mentions that ‘[v]ibration is detected best on hairy, bony skin and is more difficult to detect on soft, fleshy areas of the body.’ Women make up 20% of the US airforce and given women have breasts and don’t tend to have particularly hairy chests, this sounds like it might be something of a problem for them. 43 Failing to account for female bodies in the military doesn’t just result in equipment that doesn’t work for women: it can injure them too.

It doesn’t help that Windsor, Ontario, the heart of the auto industry in Canada, has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country. The result is that workers know that if they demand better protections the response will be ‘Fine, you’re out of here. There’s ten women outside the door who want your job.’ We’ve heard factory workers tell us this in the exact same words,’ says Rochon Ford. If this sounds illegal, well, it may be. Over the past hundred years or so, a framework of employee rights has been established. They vary from country to country, but they tend to include a right to paid sick and maternity leave, a right to a set number of hours, and protection from unfair and/or sudden dismissal. But these rights only apply if you are an employee. And, increasingly, many workers are not. In many nail salons, technicians are technically independent contractors.

We know that 75% of UK families on low to middle incomes now work outside standard hours, but most formal childcare is still only available between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. It must be booked and paid for well in advance, which is difficult if you don’t know when you’re going to need it.

Caroline Criado Perez,Invisible Women,"[Note] This is likely to be a conservative estimate, because it’s based on current wages – and like properly paid paternity leave, publicly funded childcare has also been shown to lower the gender pay gap. In Denmark where all children are entitled to a full-time childcare place from the age of twenty-six weeks to six years, the gender wage gap in 2012 was around 7%, and had been falling for years. In the US, where childcare is not publicly provided until age five in most places, the pay gap in 2012 was almost double this and has stalled. 86 We like to think that the unpaid work women do is just about individual women caring for their individual family members to their own individual benefit. It isn’t. Women’s unpaid work is work that society depends on, and it is work from which society as a whole benefits. When the government cuts public services that we all pay for with our taxes, demand for those services doesn’t suddenly cease. The work is simply transferred onto women, with all the attendant negative impacts on female paid labour-participation   rates, and GDP. And so the unpaid work that women do isn’t simply a matter of ‘choice’. It is built into the system we have created – and it could just as easily be built out of it.

This is a problem, because male and female legislators inevitably bring different perspectives to politics. Women lead different lives to men because of both their sex and their gender.

When the women were displaced and dispersed – and then had their homes demolished – they lost all that. But because we don’t measure women’s unpaid work, a need to maintain such informal ties once again was not factored into any rebuilding efforts.  [Note] The social networks provided by the housing projects also meant that women felt safer, which in turn made them more mobile. ‘[T]he city wasn’t too bad,’ explained one woman, ‘because everybody knew everybody, and then once you got towards Orleans and Claiborne [streets], you were safe because you knew everyone.’ The mobility of women living in the Bricks was also supported by the regular buses and variety of stores in walking distance. But again, all of that has changed. Walking is no longer an option for many of the displaced women who now live miles from the nearest stores. And bus schedules have been changed: where buses used to come along every fifteen minutes, it’s now not unusual to have to wait for an hour. One woman lost her job as a result. Rather like the planners behind Brazil’s Minha Casa, Minha Vida, transporting low-income women to their places of employment does not seem to have been considered a priority by the architects of New Orleans’ regeneration. There is no international law requiring that women’s voices be included in post-disaster planning – although based on the evidence perhaps there should be.

Petabytes [that’s 1,000 million million bytes to you and me] allow us to say: ‘Correlation is enough.’ We didn’t need to hypothesise about anything, we just needed to crunch the numbers – or, more accurately, ‘let statistical algorithms’ crunch the numbers. In the era of Trump, Brexit and Cambridge Analytica, this seems Pollyanna-ish to say the least, but even before these data scandals it should have been obvious that his claims were hubristic, because back in 2008 we had even less data on women than we have now.

Garry Kasparov,Deep Thinking,"[Note] Pay particular attention to point three, where Shannon bridges the gap between computer science and the metaphysical world in just thirty-five words. Since chess requires thinking, either a chess-playing machine thinks or thinking doesn’t mean what we believe it to mean. I also admire his use of the word “skillful,” since simply memorizing the rules and making random legal moves or regurgitating moves from memory (or a database) isn’t how he defines thinking. This insight echoes Norbert Wiener’s note at the end of his seminal 1948 book, Cybernetics: “Whether it is possible to construct a chess-playing machine, and whether this sort of ability represents an essential difference between the potentialities of the machine and the mind.” Shannon went on to describe the various factors a chess program would need, including the rules, piece values, an evaluation function, and, most critically, the possible search methods a future chess machine could use. He described the most fundamental element of search, what we call the “minimax” algorithm, which originated in game theory and has been applied to logical decision making in many fields. Very simply put, a minimax system evaluates possibilities and sorts them from best to worst.",2023-04-01
Garry Kasparov,Deep Thinking,"[Note] When computers capable of running chess code finally came along a few years later, they were so dismally slow that it was assumed that Shannon was right, and that the best hope for real progress was Type B. It was a logical conclusion, since machines that could search Shannon’s optimistic one-position-per-microsecond benchmark were still decades away. Any program that looked at every possible move would take weeks to reach the search depth required to play a rational game and years to play well. But as it turned out, and not for the last time, the assumption that humanlike was better than brute force was largely wrong. IN 1956, the nuclear laboratory of Los Alamos was the site of the next advance in chess computing, taking the theories of Wiener, Turing, and Shannon and turning them into an actual chess-playing machine. One of the first computers, the gigantic MANIAC 1, had twenty-four hundred vacuum tubes and the revolutionary ability to store programs in memory. As soon as it was delivered, some of the H-bomb scientists tested it out by writing a chess program. Of course! The computer’s resources were so limited that they had to use a reduced board, just six-by-six squares, without bishops. After playing against itself and then losing to a strong player (despite the human playing without a queen), the machine beat a young volunteer who had just learned the game.

Garry Kasparov,Deep Thinking,"Romanticizing the loss of jobs to technology is little better than complaining that antibiotics put too many grave diggers out of work. The transfer of labor from humans to our inventions is nothing less than the history of civilization. It is inseparable from centuries of rising living standards and improvements in human rights. What a luxury to sit in a climate-controlled room with access to the sum of human knowledge on a device in your pocket and lament how we don’t work with our hands anymore!  [Note] There are still plenty of places in the world where people work with their hands all day, and also live without clean water and modern medicine. They are literally dying from a lack of technology. It’s not just college-educated professionals who are under pressure today. Call center employees in India are losing their jobs to artificially intelligent agents. Electronics assembly-line workers in China are being replaced by robots at a rate that would shock even Detroit. There is an entire generation of workers in the developing world who were often the first in their families to escape farming and other subsistence labor. Will they have to return to the fields? Some may, but for the vast majority this isn’t an option. It’s like asking if all the lawyers and doctors will have to “return to the factories” that don’t exist anymore. There is no back, only forward. We don’t get to pick and choose when technological progress stops, or where. Companies are globalized and labor is becoming nearly as fluid as capital. People whose jobs are on the chopping block of automation are afraid that the current wave of tech will impoverish them, but they also depend on the next wave of technology to generate the economic growth that is the only way to create sustainable new jobs. Even if it were possible to mandate slowing down the development and implementation of intelligent machines (how?), it would only ease the pain for a few for a little while and make the situations worse for everyone in the long run. Unfortunately, there is a long tradition of politicians and CEOs sacrificing the long term and the greater good in order to satisfy a small constituency at the moment. Educating and retraining a workforce to adapt to change is far more effective than trying to preserve that workforce in some sort of Luddite bubble. But that takes planning and sacrifice, words more associated with a game of chess than with today’s leaders.",2023-04-01
Garry Kasparov,Deep Thinking,"[Note] The apparent similarity between early chess programs and human beginners is a trap, part of the familiar fallacy of expecting computers to think like humans. As Moravec’s paradox dictates, computers are very good at chess calculation, which is the part humans have the most trouble with. Computers are poor at recognizing patterns and making analogical evaluations, a human strength. Other than checkmate, nearly every factor that goes into evaluating a chess position is conditional on many other factors. This, along with the slow speed of computers at the time, is why early experts thought it would be impossible to make a strong Type A (brute force) program. They were wrong, although it would take a while to figure that out. Many of the first programs were attempts at Type B, which sought to intelligently reduce the size of the algorithm’s search tree early on the way humans do. Other research groups saw the advantage of tackling the relatively concrete task of improving the machine’s search speed and therefore depth, which always improved strength in a predictable way. The first program that played competent chess was developed at MIT in the late 1950s, a few years ahead of the Soviet program beaten by Bronstein. The Kotok-McCarthy program ran on an IBM 7090 and included some of the techniques that would become the basis for every strong algorithm that followed, including alpha-beta pruning to speed up the search. The leading Soviet team at the time took a Type A approach, which is interesting considering that they were surrounded by strong chess players, unlike the Americans. Alan Kotok and John McCarthy were both very weak players and had a romantic view of how the game was played. To me, the Soviet embrace of brute force search is not ironic at all, but, to the contrary, reflects a superior understanding of how good chess is played and won. Chess is a very precise game when played well. The advantage of a single pawn is usually more than enough for victory between strong players. Weak players see chess through the lens of their own limitations and frequent mistakes. A novice or nonplayer sees the game as a roller-coaster of cut and thrust, full of blunders on both sides that swing the game this way and that.",2023-04-01
Garry Kasparov,Deep Thinking,"[Note] In my lectures to business audiences I call this the “gravity of past success,” and often give a painful example from my own career: the loss of my world championship title to Vladimir Kramnik in 2000. I was at the height of success at the time, in the midst of an unprecedented winning streak at top-level tournaments and raising my rating to its highest peak ever. I felt great and had prepared deeply for our October match in London, scheduled for sixteen games. Kramnik was my most dangerous opponent, twelve years younger and with years of strong performances against me. But it was his first world championship match and my seventh. I had experience, better results, and felt good. How could I lose? The answer was “by playing into my opponent’s strength and refusing to adapt.” Kramnik had prepared very cleverly, using his turns with the black pieces to draw me into tedious positions I disliked. This was entirely to his credit, and it was up to me to find a strategic response for the rest of the match. But instead of avoiding these positions entirely and playing to my strengths, I continued to charge straight ahead like a bull at a red cape. I eventually lost the match with two losses, thirteen draws, and without winning a single game. I was thirty-seven at the time, not exactly ancient. And I was never afraid of pushing myself to stay on the cutting edge, including my embrace of technology. My weakness was a refusal to admit that Kramnik had outprepared me—preparation was supposed to be my strong suit. Each one of my successes up to that moment was like being dipped in bronze over and over, each success, each layer, making me more rigid and unable to change, and, more importantly, unable to see the need to change. This metaphorical gravity isn’t only a problem for individuals, or only a matter of ego. Fighting against disruption and change is also a standard business practice, one that is usually employed by a market leader trying to protect that lead. There are countless examples of this from the real world, but I’ll take one ad absurdum case from science fiction, the 1951 movie The Man in the White Suit, starring Alec Guinness. Guinness, the protagonist, is a rogue research chemist who invents a miracle fiber that never wears out and never gets dirty. Instead of the fame, riches, and Nobel Prize you might expect, he ends up being chased through the streets by angry mobs once various interest groups realize what his invention will mean. No more demand for new cloth, so the textile industry will be wiped out along with thousands of union jobs. No more need for laundry soap or laundry workers, who join in the pursuit.",2023-04-01
Garry Kasparov,Deep Thinking,"This is what different systems are indeed doing today, using techniques like genetic algorithms and neural nets to basically program themselves. Unfortunately, they have not proved to be stronger than the traditional fast-searching programs that rely more on hard-coded human knowledge—at least not yet. But this is the fault of chess, not of the methods. The more complex the subject, the more likely it is to benefit from an open, self-creating algorithm versus fixed human knowledge.  [Note] Chess just isn’t complex enough and even I can admit that there is more to life than chess. It took thirty years, but my beloved game was revealed to be too vulnerable to brute force fast searching to require strategic thinking from machines in order to defeat the best humans. As much work as went into tuning Deep Blue’s evaluation function and training its openings, the depressing truth is that a few years and a new generation of faster chips later, none of it would have mattered very much. For better or worse, chess just wasn’t deep enough to force the chess-machine community to find a solution beyond speed, something many among them lamented. In a 1989 article, two of the leading figures in computer chess wrote an essay titled “Perspectives on Falling from Grace” that critiqued the methods by which chess machines had finally approached Grandmaster strength. Soviet computer scientist Mikhail Donskoy was one of the creators of the Kaissa program that won the first computer chess world championship in 1974. Jonathan Schaeffer of Canada and his colleagues at the University of Alberta have been at the forefront of game-playing machines for decades. Along with his work on chess, he’s produced a strong poker program and his program Chinook battled for the checkers world championship and nearly solved the game entirely. In their provocative essay in a leading computer chess journal, Donskoy and Schaeffer describe how computer chess had separated from AI over the years. They credit this separation to being a consequence of the overwhelming success of the alpha-beta search algorithm. Why look at anything else if the winning method was already in hand? As they write, “It is unfortunate that computer chess was given such a powerful idea so early in its formative stages.” Winning was what mattered and faster was better, so engineering took over from science. Patterns, knowledge, and other humanlike methods were discarded as the super-fast brute force machines took home all the trophies.",2023-04-01
Garry Kasparov,Deep Thinking,"[Note] Lastly on talent, don’t tell me that hard work can be more important than talent. This is a handy platitude for motivating our kids to study or practice piano, but as I wrote ten years ago in How Life Imitates Chess, hard work is a talent. The ability to push yourself, to keep working, practicing, studying more than others is itself a talent. If anyone could do it, everyone would. As with any talent, it must be cultivated to blossom. It can be convenient to frame work ethic as a moral matter, and certainly there is the usual intertwining of nature and nurture involved. And I would hate to provide anyone with a genetic excuse for taking it easy. But to me it has always sounded a little absurd to say that “player X has more talent but player Y wins because she works harder.” Reaching peak human performance requires maximizing every aspect of our abilities whenever we can, including preparation and training, not only while at the chessboard or in the boardroom.",2023-04-01
Garry Kasparov,Deep Thinking,"That was far from the case back in 1985. Tactical calculations were still a computer strength, but only shallow sequences three or four moves deep. This was more than enough to beat most amateurs consistently, although strong players became adept at setting tactical traps that were too deep for the computers to see. It seemed paradoxical that the machine’s strength of flawless calculation was also a major weakness. The brute force “exhaustive search” method of checking every one of millions of positions also meant that the search tree couldn’t reach very deep. If you could find a tactical threat that struck the decisive blow four moves (eight ply) away when the computer could only see three moves (six ply) deep, it wouldn’t see it coming until it was too late.

Gymnast George Eyser was missing a leg, undoubtedly his claim to fame. Watson’s search therefore turned up lots of results with Eyser’s name and the anatomical word “leg.” So far, so good. But the machine got wrong what Jennings got right because it couldn’t understand that having a leg is not an oddity. Jennings was wrong in a human way, with a logical assumption that lacked data.

Garry Kasparov,Deep Thinking,"When Michie and a few colleagues wrote an experimental data-based machine-learning chess program in the early 1980s, it had an amusing result. They fed hundreds of thousands of positions from Grandmaster games into the machine, hoping it would be able to figure out what worked and what did not. At first it seemed to work. Its evaluation of positions was more accurate than conventional programs. The problem came when they let it actually play a game of chess. The program developed its pieces, launched an attack,  [Note] and immediately sacrificed its queen! It lost in just a few moves, having given up the queen for next to nothing. Why did it do it? Well, when a Grandmaster sacrifices his queen it’s nearly always a brilliant and decisive blow.

They will always play the best move in the search tree and can do no other. Poker robots may have other ideas, but chess machines cannot bluff. One would never intentionally play an inferior move in the hope its opponent wouldn’t find the refutation. A partial exception is if the programmers change its settings in advance to play for a win at all costs, telling it that a draw must be avoided.  [Note] This is called the “contempt factor” setting, and can encourage the machine to play riskier continuations instead of settling if the position is a draw.

When the 1996 match is remembered at all, it’s because my loss in game one was the first time a machine had beaten the world champion in a classical time control game. Prior to that, I had played quite a few games against machines at faster time controls and lost a number of them. What we call “rapid” games allow between fifteen and thirty minutes per player for the whole game.

Garry Kasparov,Deep Thinking,"I was also prepared, and varied from a previous game of mine on the tenth move with an improvement. I wasn’t going to go into a defensive crouch. I wanted to see what this thing could do. This wasn’t a blitz or rapid game; we had hours on our clocks, not just a few minutes. This gave me enough time to think, so I wasn’t afraid of entering sharp complications.  [Note] Deep Blue played well in the early stages, gaining a slight advantage typical of the white pieces. After I made an inaccuracy it played several more strong moves to create real threats for the first time. I glanced up at Hsu, a habit rendered pointless in this match. My position was deteriorating. This thing was strong. This was different.",2023-04-01
Garry Kasparov,Deep Thinking,"[Note] According to Monty Newborn’s book on the match, IBM’s stock rose an equivalent of $3,310 million in little more than a week, a week that the rest of the Dow Jones went down significantly. I should have demanded stock options instead of a 4–1 prize split! Deep Blue’s name was everywhere in the media and the IBM team and the IBM brand went with it. It was good for me too, of course, especially in America where chess champions were hardly household names. I was getting more US media attention for beating Deep Blue in Philadelphia than I had for beating Anand in a world championship match in New York City. It turned out that even world champions are outranked by defenders of humanity.",2023-04-01
Garry Kasparov,Deep Thinking,"This is a valid perspective, even though I would give myself a little more credit than “stumbling” upon what worked. Although I had faced Deep Blue only five times, I had a great deal of insight into the general weaknesses of chess machines. They often had a poor grasp of positional factors like space—how much territory each side’s forces control—a defect evident in the game six wipeout. My knowledge of machine tendencies would prove to be no substitute for specific knowledge about Deep Blue in the rematch, however, and it would even work against me when my faulty assumptions were refuted.  [Note] Returning to tennis, I learned in the first match that my opponent had a lousy backhand, and I targeted that weakness. In the rematch, I expected Deep Blue to still have a lousy backhand—a poor understanding of space, in particular—but that weakness was almost entirely gone, as it showed to shocking effect in game two.",2023-04-01
Garry Kasparov,Deep Thinking,"This tale acquired new life when election analyst Nate Silver used it as the centerpiece for an entire chapter of his 2012 book, The Signal and the Noise. The narrative suggested by Frederic and spread by Campbell was irresistible: Kasparov lost to Deep Blue because of a bug! Writes Silver, “ [Note] The bug was anything but unfortunate for Deep Blue: it was likely what allowed the computer to beat Kasparov.” TIME, Wired, and other outlets ran with breathless variations on this theme, each story containing more errors about chess and more silly assumptions about my mental state than the last. I’m sincerely glad that my matches and chess have acquired the cultural cachet to become the subject of so much popular writing and other appearances in pop culture. The problem is, that just like most of the chessboards you see in the movies are turned sideways, the people writing about chess in popular publications often have absolutely no idea what they are talking about. Instead of taking the time to consult with a professional player, they take it for granted that winning a plastic trophy in a second-grade chess tournament qualifies them to comment insightfully on the moves and mindset of a world champion. Much of what Silver gets right in his chess chapter is from other sources and it stands out when so much else is wrong. Among many other things, he misunderstands the workings of opening books, calls the middlegame “the midgame,” and makes a complete hash of game six. That is still to come, of course, but for one sample he writes, “Kasparov did not know the Caro-Kann [Defense]…” It’s true I had given up playing the Caro-Kann in my youth, but I also cowrote a book on it. It’s also obvious to any chess player that you can know an opening quite well even if you don’t play it yourself if it’s one that you regularly have to play against, as I did. Getting back to the game at hand, Silver ignores the fact that Frederic writes in the very ChessBase article that started it all that “somewhere around here Fritz started to announce mates.” Even little Fritz on a home computer was seeing well over a dozen moves deep, and we knew Deep Blue was much, much faster. It was well understood that searching that far into a position was quite possible for a machine if the moves were mostly forced and material was limited. The search tree narrows dramatically and “singular extensions” such as those Deep Thought had a decade earlier can push very far. When there are checks against the king and only four rooks and a few pawns on the board, as was the case at that point in the game, Deep Blue easily could have reached that search depth in a few minutes. You can even see in the machine’s log files, published years later, that it reached a depth of twenty ply a few moves earlier, on move forty-one when there were even more pieces on the board.",2023-04-01
